While a high volume of literary evidence on this Islamic social finance instrument is available, the research motivation and study findings are diverse. Therefore, we conduct a bibliometric analysis of waqf literature to understand the pattern and direction of research on Waqf broadly. We collect 319 articles, and reviews on Waqf extracted from the Scopus database, covering a period exceeding 100 years from 1914 until June 2020. We employ RStudio, VOSviewer, and Microsoft Excel for citation analysis, content, and network analyses. A systematic review of recent publications complemented the bibliometric analysis. Alongside revealing the most relevant scientific actors in waqf literature, most researchers on Waqf were from Malaysia; they conducted studies widely on cash Waqf. As a result, we identify four research themes for waqf studies which include (1) Cash Waqf endowment, (2) Islamic accountability and Waqf, (3) Waqf and Islamic social finance, and (4) Governance for Waqf endowment. This is the first study to provide a bibliometric review of waqf literature to address gaps in the existing research and offer directions for future research which could benefit early-career Islamic finance researchers.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/a-note-on-covid-19-instigated-maximum-drawdown-in-islamic-markets', 'Paper_Names': 'A note on COVID-19 instigated maximum drawdown in Islamic markets versus conventional counterparts', 'Publication_Date': '2 Sep 2021', 'Author_Names': '  Rashedul Hasan ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/rashedul-hasan ', 'Abstract': 'This study uncovers the impact of the COVID-19 on the Islamic equity markets compared to their conventional counterparts. The extremely large-scale drawdown across the markets signifies an indiscriminate impact. To some extent, Asian Islamic markets show relative resilience to their counterparts. Both Islamic and non-Islamic Asian markets signpost a quicker recovery than the rest of the regions, the Middle East & Africa, Europe, and America. It appears that a higher return leads to a smaller maximum drawdown, while higher volatility leads to a larger maximum drawdown. Despite the large-scale drawdown, a number of markets secure a positive return where Islamic markets outperform the counterparts. Conventional markets respond to the COVID-19 aftershock homogenously as a result of their high interlinkages. Collectively, these results reinforce the view that in the crisis period, Islamic markets are more resilient.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/bank-stock-valuation-theories-do-they-explain-prices-based-on-the', 'Paper_Names': 'Bank stock valuation theories: do they explain prices based on theories?', 'Publication_Date': '1 Mar 2022', 'Author_Names': '  Alireza Zarei ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/alireza-zarei ', 'Abstract': 'PurposeThe objective of this paper is to investigate the validity of stock valuation theories and their forecasting ability by conducting an empirical study. It employs four most commonly used theories which are then tested using 19-year banking-firm market data. The usefulness of these models demonstrates with promising results.Design/methodology/approachThis paper conducts a multi-country study using the multi-model testing approach to evaluate validity of theories and forecast accuracy of banking firms. It employs four methodology models used in finance literature; (1) P/E multiples model, (2) accounting-information-based clean surplus model, (3) theoretical model based on Gordon and Shapiro (1956) method and (4) the Damodaran-Kottler Free Cash Flow or FCF theory based on discounting model.FindingsThe tests show that the four theories under tests have a significant fit with actual price formation.

Our findings, based on the analysis of 545 UK firms that undertook M&A during 2001-2018, are consistent with these hypotheses.

Based on datasets covering the period from 2000 to 2012 (i.e. production quota era), analysed using the vector autoregression/vector error correction (VAR-VEC) framework, the study’s results indicate that OPEC cheating, mainly instigated by the amount of spare production capacity available to OPEC members, does not seem to have a significant direct effect on international oil prices. However, the degree of cheating by OPEC member-states might disrupt its ability to maintain surplus capacity enough to reduce price speculation in the oil markets. Should cheating behaviour in OPEC continue unabated, this could jeopardise an effective energy regulatory framework and market transparency. The paper, therefore, recommends a policy action in OPEC to support the redesigning of the existing quota system that is fair and just to its members and capable of controlling any cheating behaviour.

Documentary review and semi-structured interviews are used for data collection. Analysis is informed by the ‘Institutional Logics Perspective’ and Bourdieu’s notion of ‘power as capital in a field’.Findings: Research findings illustrate how some local actors pre-dispose themselves in promoting strict compliance to IFRS, while others endeavour to ensure compliance to ‘Islamic Sharia requirements’ in financial reporting. In this power dynamic, there is an ongoing ‘constructive resistance’ actively exerted by the latter group against the former, preserving the existence of religion-based reporting demands in Islamic accounting standardisation approaches.

Design/methodology/approach: The six years of secondary data, including the annual reports of 2013–2018, were collected from the websites of all the seven listed Islamic banks, i.e. 100% of the population available during the period of study. The study used a content analysis approach for systematically categorizing and analysing the contents disclosed in the annual report. A total compliance score based on 133 reporting items of IFSB standard-4 were considered for content analysis. Furthermore, this study applied the ordinary least square to investigate the impact of corporate governance on IFSB standard-4. Findings: This study found that the level of compliance with the IFSB standard by the Islamic banks in Bangladesh is poor, as the overall compliance status is 44.83%. Further, this study observed a significant and positive influence of the Shari’ah supervisory committee, the board size, accounting experts on the board, foreign ownership and institutional ownership on the level of compliance with IFSB standard-4.

Furthermore, our study is the first to examine the relationship between segment reporting quality and the cost of debt capital after the adoption of IFRS 8 and the moderating role of the country-level enforcement system.

In the first, we track the relevance of monetary policy decisions originating in developed economies for interbank funding liquidity risk in BRICS economies during crisis periods by applying a time-varying parameter model in a Bayesian framework. The results indicate weak associations between interbank credit market and monetary policy and market conditions in the US. In contrast, the Federal Reserve's National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) — a representative of the health of both real and financial sectors in the US — matters more. The temporal patterns of the results imply that key central banking decisions precede or coincide with low degrees of associations. In the second, we examine whether interbank credit crunch exerts an influence on market liquidity risk in BRICS economies using a Granger causality approach. The results reveal that interbank credit crunch depresses market liquidity in the corresponding domestic market and that the state of fear and credit market conditions in the US exert some influence in this regard. Overall, our findings hint at judicious market intervention and liquidity management by BRICS central banks.\"}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/is-there-a-trade-off-between-accrual-based-and-real-earnings-mana', 'Paper_Names': 'Is there a trade-off between accrual-based and real earnings management activities in the presence of (fe) male auditors?', 'Publication_Date': '13 Nov 2020', 'Author_Names': '  Andrews Owusu  Andrews Owusu ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/andrews-owusu https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/andrews-owusu ', 'Abstract': 'Prior research suggests that the presence of high quality auditors (i.e. proxied by audit firm characteristics) constrains accrual-based earnings management, but it inadvertently leads to higher real activities manipulation.

Over the next 60 years, the city expanded into a major urban regional conurbation. It now covers an area of 2,790\\xa0km\\n              2 and has a population of around 7.7 million. In the last two\\xa0decades, market-driven, fast-track development, underpinned by road infrastructure has accelerated the city's urban transformation. Especially over the last two\\xa0decades, a spate of urban redevelopments, including commercial and retail complexes, specialised centres, industrial parks, educational complexes and residential estates have transformed the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Region (KLMR) beyond recognition. KL is only one example among many of intensive Southeast Asian property-led urban development, fuelled by demographic pressures and global capital inflows that transformed the regional natural and built environments. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of globalisation, neoliberalism and property-led development, on the built form and socio-cultural legacies of the KLMR. Design/methodology/approach: The major aim of this study is to determine how neoliberalism and property-led development have impacted the urban form and structure of the KLMR. The methodology applied in this study concentrates mainly on the use of qualitative research methods. The major qualitative research methods include qualitative analysis, field surveys and observations, primary and secondary data collection. The approach in this study is to exemplify the shift from government-sponsored development in the post-independence period to the current globalised-private oriented development. Findings: The major findings of this research suggest that the global, property-led mode of urban development, whilst superficially successful, undermined traditional and tropical-climate urban landscapes. It also bequeathed many urban or property level problems, including traffic congestion, air pollution, planning governance and building management issues. The paper outlines narratives for a more balanced and sustainable mode of urban development, which is more in tune with local culture and climatic conditions. Originality/value: This paper provides a deep insight analysis and evaluation of KL's growth from a small town into a global metropolitan region where property-led development dictates the rules and determines the character of the city.\\n            \"}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/measuring-the-impact-of-corporate-governance-on-non-financial-rep', 'Paper_Names': 'Measuring the impact of corporate governance on non-financial reporting in the top HEIs worldwide', 'Publication_Date': '12 May 2022', 'Author_Names': '  Mehul Chhatbar ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/mehul-chhatbar ', 'Abstract': 'Purpose – This study aims to measure the relationship between corporate governance and Non-Financial Reporting (NFR) in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs).

Notwithstanding vested interests and the unrecognised paradox of adopting environmental business strategies, the implementation of sustainability accounting and reporting (SAR) is imperative to catalyse economic transition away from fossil-fuel and plastic configurations to more sustainable ones.  The research proceeded sequentially.  First, it scanned the backdrop to the SAR problem and identified key associated institutions and a corpus of recent literature.  An initial review to disentangle its conflicting threads generated three themes of ‘climate crisis’ and ‘conservative’ or more ‘radical’ SAR reform paradigms.  Iteratively harnessing this thematic lens, the investigation re-examined the SAR literature corpus.  It detected fragmented SAR responses to the climate crisis.  Accordingly, the research reformulated its first theme to ‘dystopic climate crisis fragmentation’ but only refined the other two conservative or radical themes to take account of materiality and the split between Anglo-Saxon (IFRS, SSAB) or global and continental institutions (UN, EU, GRI).  Conservatives defend incremental standard improvements but retain a single materiality investor-focus.  Radicals seek to implement double materiality with a broader spectrum of stakeholders in mind.  Both approaches have theoretical as well as pragmatic advantages and disadvantages, so the SAR contention rumbles on.  Whilst the standard setting landscape is evolving, division, paradox and contention remain.

However, whereas subsidy effects are increasing over time tax credit effects are not. Although their respective effects are “small”, they are not negligible: in round terms, an additional $1 of public R&D support of either type induces 7.5 cents of additional private R&D expenditure. Sources of heterogeneity in the reported effects include: tax credits are most effectively delivered as “incremental” schemes, are more effective in economies with a balanced “policy-mix” regime, and are generally less effective for micro firms and SMEs than for large firms; while subsidies are more effective for manufacturing firms, although not for high-tech firms, and are more effective than tax credits in economies predominantly using subsidies.

This implies that inbound tourism in Singapore results in a higher demand for its domestic products. This increased demand for Singaporean products, in turn, acting as a positive advertising campaign in favor of Singapore, promotes inbound tourism to this country. The policy implication of these findings is twofold. First, inbound tourism in Singapore not only contributes directly to GDP, employment, and the current account via tourism revenues but also by stimulating exports it improves further the current account of Singapore. Secondly, the stimulation of exports induced by inbound tourism creates favorable sustainability conditions for the entire tourism sector.

However, governments in these countries have been reluctant to relinquish the pre-existing controls on economy and have adopted nuanced and sophisticated approaches to retain control. In such context, scholars may find it challenging to investigate the role played by the state in the success or failure of attempted market reforms. This work investigates the different forms of state-induced accounting controls that may preserve the status quo within the economy during transition, using Myanmar as an example. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted a longitudinal qualitative research method aiming to reveal the very processes and mechanisms used by the banks and their evolution over time. This method is in accordance with the historical institutionalist perspective that they have applied within this research. Findings: The authors found that the Myanmar government embarked on the privatisation of their financial sector from 1990 to 2016 as a major public sector reform initiative. Under the guise of market reforms, it used both state-led and market-led controls to emulate and retain the socialist banking model where banks are used to fund the immediate government's budget deficits. This created a series of intended and unintended consequences, resulting in the ultimate failure of the government's market reforms. Research limitations/implications: Previously, research on public sector management accounting in emerging economies was not relying consistently on using theory. The relative limited theorisation led to gaps when attempting to understand and explain the opaque forms of state control mechanisms in transition economies. By applying historical institutionalist perspective, and a more theory-driven, reflective approach to the interpretation of the data collected, the authors have provided a deeper insight and understanding on how different forms of state controls can emerge, adapt and persist in transition economies such as Myanmar. Practical implications: The authors demonstrated that though the state may have implemented market reforms to signal regimes change, this does not necessarily mean that the government has relinquished their control on the economy. The state could take a more sophisticated, covert approach towards state controls leading to both intended and unintended consequences. Thus, even if the state's preferences change, the decisions cannot be easily reversed, as path-dependent state controls may have become pervasive affecting any further institutional and policy developments. Thus, the authors suggest that governments in both transition and developed economies should be cautious when enacting regulations on corporate control. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors have applied a historical institutional perspective in their analysis instead of the more widely used sociological, institutionalist approach. This allowed authors to harness rich longitudinal data indicating that market reforms and their success or failure should be examined as an ongoing process rather than a completed action. This is especially important in transition economies where the state may be unwilling to renounce the existing controls on the industry and may resort to more opaque forms of state control, eventually obstructing the intended reforms.\"}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/an-appraisal-of-turkeys-voluntary-individual-pension-system-from-', 'Paper_Names': \"An appraisal of Turkey's voluntary individual pension system from a perspective of pension equality\", 'Publication_Date': '25 Oct 2020', 'Author_Names': '  Mehtap Hisarciklilar ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/mehtap-hisarciklilar ', 'Abstract': 'Since 2003, Turkey’s pension policy has been increasingly based on facilitation of individual savings administered by private pension funds.

Monthly contributions to pension accounts are explored on the basis of socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the customers of a currently operating pension company. Findings reveal that differences in people’s saving capacities have become a source for pension inequality. Furthermore, state subsidies, which increase in proportion to individual contributions, strengthen unequal distributional dynamics.

Thus, the stability of the banking industry is one of the critical ingredients in economic growth. This paper analyzes how bank capital, credit and liquidity requirements impact bank solvency, using ten major banks controlling 90% of the UK market share in 2009-2018. The GMM model indicates a strong association between credit and liquidity risks. That is, when banks finance a risky or distressed project, this will lead to an increase in nonperforming loans (NPL), which reduces bank liquidity. Poor liquidity profile of a bank may restrict its ability to act as a financial intermediary. In addition, the findings indicate that efficiency, asset quality, and economic growth have a significant positive effect on the solvency of banks. The results also show that the regulatory capital (Tier1) has a positive significant influence on bank solvency. Further, the results indicate that during the economic boom, banks tend to increase their regulatory capital. Therefore, there is a need to ensure that during the \"good time\", banks can accumulate enough capital that is genuinely capable of absorbing negative shock. Also, it is important for banks to ensure that they are efficient but also have a robust credit appraisal system to reduce NPL. This paper also demonstrates the implications of increased capital requirements. That is, increased capital requirements ensure not only banks are liquid but also solvent, which allows them to provide financial intermediation.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/can-citizen-science-increase-trust-in-research-a-case-study-of-de', 'Paper_Names': 'Can Citizen Science Increase Trust in Research ?

We evaluate the quality of corporate and government mercury reporting via the Australian National Pollutant Inventory (NPI), which underpins Australia's reporting under the Minamata Convention, a global agreement to reduce mercury pollution. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative characteristics of accounting information are used as a theoretical frame to analyse ten interviews with thirteen interviewees as well as 54 submissions to the 2018 governmental enquiry into the NPI. Findings: While Australian mercury accounting using the NPI is likely sufficient to meet the expected Minamata reporting requirements (especially in comparison to developing countries), we find significant limitations in relation to comparability, accuracy, timeliness and completeness. These limitations primarily relate to government (as opposed to industry) deficiencies, caused by insufficient funding. The findings suggest that multiple factors are required to realise the potential of pollutant databases for corporate accountability, including appropriate rules, ideological commitment and resourcing Practical implications: The provision of additional funding would enable the NPI to be considerably improved (for mercury as well as other pollutants), particularly in relation to the measurement and reporting of emissions from diffuse sources. Originality/value: Whilst there have been prior reviews of the NPI, none have focused on mercury, whilst conversely prior studies which have discussed mercury information have not focused on the NPI. In addition, no prior NPI studies have utilised interviews nor have engaged directly with NPI regulators. There has been little prior engagement with pollutant databases in social and environmental accounting (SEA) research.\"}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/carbon-emissions-and-firm-performance-evidence-from-financial-and', 'Paper_Names': 'Carbon emissions and firm performance: evidence from financial and non-financial firms from selected emerging economies', 'Publication_Date': '30 Nov 2021', 'Author_Names': '  Rashedul Hasan ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/rashedul-hasan ', 'Abstract': 'This paper examines the effects of carbon emissions on the accounting and market-based performance of financial and non-financial firms in emerging economies.

This study also explores whether the NLSP-SDGR nexus is contingent on the environmental sensitivity of oil industries in Libya. We employ a quantitative content analysis based on word counts to determine the level of SDGR among a cross- sectional sample of 524 observations of the major Libyan oil companies in the 2015/2016 fiscal year. Using measures derived from the World Development Indicators (WDI), a cross-sectional regression analysis has been employed to investigate how NLSP explains variations in SDGR noted in 2015/2016. Descriptive evidence in- dicates that Libyan oil companies tend to report SDG information on their websites about Good Health and Well- being (SDG3), Quality Education (SDG4), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG7), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG8), Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11), and Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG12). Our regression results suggest that the NLSP positively and significantly influences corporate commitment to the SDGR agenda among a sample of the major oil com- panies in Libya. Additionally, the environmental sensitivity of oil industries appeared to be moderating the NLSP- SDGR nexus. As SDGR tends to be a self-regulation mechanism, our empirical evidence emphasises the impor- tance of establishing effective regulatory agencies to ensure companies’ achievements of their social, environ- mental, and economic responsibilities efficiently and effectively.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/corporate-board-for-innovative-managerial-control-implications-of', 'Paper_Names': 'Corporate board for innovative managerial control: implications of corporate governance deviance perspective', 'Publication_Date': '31 Dec 2020', 'Author_Names': '  Rashedul Hasan ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/rashedul-hasan ', 'Abstract': 'Purpose: Drawing from the firm’s entrepreneurial identity and ecology perspectives, this study aims to explain why the firms deviate from standard corporate governance practices and apply innovative management control.

The authors relied on unique governance variables extracted from the Bloomberg database to develop the governance deviance index. Findings: Study unveils that deviance from governance practices influences firm’s performance. Consequently, it can be said that the firms which use innovative governance mechanisms, usually stay ahead of the market by leading the governance trends.

Design/methodology/approach: The study draws on capture theory to bring out the factors that have rendered redundant the state intervention to make corporations accountable for their environmental activities. The research setting is the oil and gas and cement industry in Nigeria. Data for the study are derived from both documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews and analysed using a thematic technique. Findings: The findings of the paper demonstrate a regulatory failure to hold corporations to account for their environmental activities. A lack of political will, outdated regulations and the manipulation of the regulators, all have played a part in preventing corporations from being accountable for their activities. In addition, the widespread elite corruption in the country has provided corporations with leeway to manipulate their environmental accountability practices. The study emphasises the need for continuous review of the regulations and efforts to reduce corruption in order to promote corporations' environmental accountability in Nigeria. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to Nigeria, oil and gas and cement industries. The theoretical lens can be used to address problem of capture of the regulations and institution in the country. Practical implications: The practical implication is that it would enhance environmental regulations in Nigeria and emerging economies. It will also provide support from researchers emerging markets on the adoption of capture theory in future research. Social implications: It will promote corporate best environmental practices in the country. It will reduce the issues surrounding environmental accountability practices and create awareness on environmental issues among the populace. It will create the impression that corporations will be held accountable for their environmental activities in the country and the need to have improved environmental regulations in the country. Originality/value: The study adds to the debate on corporate environmental accountability practices engendering insights from the Nigerian oil and gas and cement industry.

Our study distinguishes between ESG performance that is used to indicate an effective commitment to ESG strategies, and ESG disclosure that represents an effort to construct an image of commitment designed to positively influence stakeholders’ perceptions. Supporting a version of legitimacy theory, we find that lending institutions value both ESG performance and disclosure and integrate ESG information in their credit decisions – in that firms with stronger ESG performance have a lower cost of debt, and ESG disclosure has an equal impact on the cost of debt as ESG performance. Although these findings suggest that the market (in context) can engender more desirable social outcomes by rewarding ESG practices, it fails to distinguish between ESG performance and disclosure (which may be contrasted as the more substantive and the more symbolic). Moreover, our results also reflect upon the importance of the role that civil society and the state play in addressing and exploring the limitations of free-market regimes.

The French Indochina War (FIW) from 1946-1954 furnishes useful insights with some resonance for current challenges. A combination of pre-exiting conditions, catalysts and operational drivers caused the cathartic 1954 French defeat. Pre-conditions included the illegitimacy of the colonial regime, repression that polarised nationalist sentiment. Economically, pernicious terms of trade suppressed industrialisation but oiled speculation until suddenly reversed by devaluation in 1953 that reflected financial disengagement by France but increased American involvement. Vacillating metropolitan and the dubious colonial regime of the ‘night club’ Emperor, Bảo Đại, fuelled political instability. Militarily, after the disastrous evacuation of the RC4 in 1950, Việt Minh men and supplies poured across the Chinese frontier. In 1954, financial constraints and the looming international peace conference catalysed Navarre, the new French commander, to gamble on a battle of attrition. He bet that the Việt Minh would be unable drag artillery to the remote jungle outpost of Diên Biên Phú, but he underestimated their determination, strength, and adaptability. In early December partisans resented the bungled evacuation of Lai Châu. The entrenched camp’s defences were inadequate and neither infantry sorties nor napalm suppressed VM artillery in the surrounding hills. The French aero-logistical sub-system was overstretched, and significant parachute supplies fell into enemy hands. Navarre scattered his reserves on a futile and remote side show, Operation Atlante. The Americans prevaricated and refused to unleash their B29 fleet. ‘Iacta alea est’ - the die was cast.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/global-trends-in-board-diversity-research-a-bibliometric-view', 'Paper_Names': 'Global trends in board diversity research: a bibliometric view', 'Publication_Date': '23 Nov 2021', 'Author_Names': '  Andrews Owusu ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/andrews-owusu ', 'Abstract': 'Purpose: This study aims to identify the main research development on board diversity and offers a quantitative synopsis of key themes and contributors, knowledge gaps and provides directions for further work.

First, it assesses existing local accounting and financial reporting practices in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), focusing on the extent to which recent government financial statements published by ten selected countries adhere to mainstream qualitative features of public sector reporting. Second, it investigates the multiple institutional logics at play in the context of government accounting reforms (GARs) in SSA, involving international organisations, epistemic community members, policy makers and local actors. Data for the study are drawn from a content analysis and disclosure scoring of ten SSA government financial statements, supplemented by forty semi-structured interviews carried out in Nigeria and Tanzania. Our findings demonstrate how the generalised assumptive logics of international organisations, coupled with the market and professional logics of epistemic community members and state logics of local politicians, have led to the marginalisation of ‘good’ existing accounting and financial reporting practice in SSA (as reflected by the extent to which government financial statements adhere to mainstream features of public sector reporting) - while providing the countries with a strong impetus for undertaking a transition towards large-scale GARs involving accrual accounting and IPSASs. The role of the epistemic community in selectively ignoring the positive aspects of local accounting practice is a significant impediment. In this way, members of this epistemic community continue to execute their ‘relational power’ generated through professional knowledge, expertise and elite connections over the local actors, hence upholding the generalised assumptive logics. The paper argues that public accountability and transparency can be strengthened in SSA countries provided there is an ‘intelligent’ application of existing regulations and accounting systems, rather than seeking to merely replace them with externally imposed large-scale GARs.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/impact-of-maoism-on-the-urban-form-and-structure-of-cities-in-mai', 'Paper_Names': 'Impact of Maoism on the urban form and structure of cities in mainland China', 'Publication_Date': '7 May 2021', 'Author_Names': '  Simon Huston ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/simon-huston ', 'Abstract': 'Evolution of a Socialist City (the Soviet model)Planned cities with emphasis on working class neighbourhoods and industries.

The empirical results from both the regional and sectoral analysis indicate a considerable heterogeneity in the estimated long-run elasticities and preference for using hierarchical model. Further, the estimated elasticities in general indicate that producers are more responsive to price increases than price decreases. In addition, empirical findings reveal that industrial energy demand is characterised by endogenous factors embedded in the asymmetric price effects. From a policy perspective, these findings provide an evidence of marked long-run impacts of energy demand (that are not observable from a traditional symmetric energy consumption pattern) required in formulating dependable energy policies.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/monitoring-exchange-rate-instability-in-12-selected-islamic-econo', 'Paper_Names': 'Monitoring exchange rate instability in 12 selected Islamic economies', 'Publication_Date': '17 May 2021', 'Author_Names': '  Alireza Zarei ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/alireza-zarei ', 'Abstract': 'Exchange rate instability has become a key concern within economic policy circles ever since the 1973 breakdown of Bretton Woods agreement; after 47 years, central bankers realize the deleterious effect of exchange rate on the economy in the 12 selected OIC member countries we studied.

Design/methodology/approach: This study extends the application and contribution of a multi-level institutional framework to previous management accounting literature on the potential relationship between performance measurement and smart city governance. The value of utilising a multi-level framework is to broaden and deepen theoretical analyses about this relationship to include the effect of political pressure from the military regime at the macro level on the institutionalisation of a performance measurement system at the micro-organisational level. Taking the New Cairo city council smart electricity networks project (Egypt) as an interpretive qualitative single-case study, data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, direct observations and documentary readings. Findings: Performance measurement systems or metrics, especially in politically and militarily sensitive smart cities, constitutes a process of cascading (macro-micro) institutionalisation that is closely linked to sustainable developments taking place in the wider arena of urban policies. Going a step further, accounting-based performance metrics, arising from political and military pressures towards public-private collaborations, contribute to smart city management and accountability (governance). Institutionalised measurement systems or performance metrics play a powerful accounting role(s) in shaping and reshaping political decisions and military actions in the city council. Originality/value: Theoretically, this study goes beyond the cascading institutionalisation process by arguing for the powerful role(s) of institutionalised accounting and performance measurement systems in smart city decision-making and governance.

The specific hypotheses under investigation relate to the method of payment (cash versus stock), target status (listed versus non-listed), diversification (domestic versus cross-border and industry-wide) and acquirers’ prior bidding experience. Additionally, the authors also investigate whether announced deals reflect an expectation about likelihood of deal completion. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyse the probability of deal success/failure in M&As by combining event study and probit regression-based methods. The authors use the standard event study methodology to calculate acquirers’ abnormal returns for up to 10 days before and after the announcement date. In the probit model, the dependent variable is the probability of deal i being failure depending on four sets of explanatory variables: method of payment, target status, diversification and acquirer bidding experience, along with a set of control variables. Findings: The findings from event study confirm that market reaction is indifferent to whether announced deals are likely to be successfully completed or not, consistent with the efficient markets hypothesis. However, the results from cross-sectional, cross-country regressions confirm that the aforementioned deal characteristics, as well as certain firm and country level attributes do influence the likelihood of whether an announced deal is subsequently completed or terminated. Originality/value: In examining whether the specific characteristics affecting the likelihood that M&A transactions, once announced, will ultimately succeed or fail, it seems natural to ask whether the market reaction at the time of deal announcement reflects an expectation regarding deal completion. This could be associated with specific deal or firm-level characteristics influencing shareholder returns or risk, and represents a unique contribution of this study, over and above the use of a global sample of M&A data.

This study aims to investigate the impact of stakeholder power on the management decisions at the BBC following the release of its 2017 gender pay gap report.To achieve this objectives, we adopt the qualitative approach, obtaining data (tweets) from social media. This approach enabled us to provide an in-depth understanding of the broken trust as well as the proximity and connectedness of BBC stakeholders who, if not employees, are incidentally TV licence fee payers. This approach also enables an understanding of stakeholder reaction following trust damage actions taken by the BBC. We further analysed the information generated from the tweets thematically which was underpinned by the stakeholders’ theory. We contribute to the body of knowledge with the following key results: (1) stakeholder proximity to gender pay differentials at the BBC was stronger and wider because of their triadic relationship with the corporation e.g. employee, British household and British public.

The difference between them is in their contractual mechanism: a bond constitutes a lender–borrower relationship between the holders and issuers whereas a sukuk constitutes a lessor-lessee, buyer-seller, or a partnership relationship. Therefore, we examine whether they are different assets in terms of their return and risk profile. Given the difference between them, it is also important to identify what drives sukuk returns. The study finds that sukuk returns are insignificantly different from those of bonds but have significantly higher risk. However, we find that sukuk investors are not sufficiently compensated for the higher risk. Overall, our study finds that sukuks’ market performance is unrelated to bond market performance, but the market performance of the industry in which the sukuk-financed project originates has a significant effect on sukuk performance.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/testing-dividend-life-cycle-theory-in-the-islamic-and-conventiona', 'Paper_Names': 'Testing Dividend Life-Cycle Theory in the Islamic and Conventional Banking Sectors of GCC Countries', 'Publication_Date': '29 Jan 2021', 'Author_Names': '  Sailesh Tanna ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/sailesh-tanna ', 'Abstract': 'Purpose – This paper aims to present a comparative evaluation of the determinants affecting the likelihood of dividend payouts by Islamic and conventional banks in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.Design/methodology/approach – The authors used the dynamic panel logit model to test dividend lifecycletheory by analyzing the determinants affecting the likelihood of dividend payouts by GCC banks.

However, the authors find marked differences in the magnitude and significance of the life-cycle characteristics explaining the likelihood of dividend payouts for Islamic and conventional banks. The authors also find that Islamic banks are smaller and less profitable relative to conventional banks but have higher growth rates, which helps to explain why the proportion of dividend non-payments is higher for Islamic banks than for conventional banks.

It answers the research question: how accounting-based key performance indicators (KPIs) were chosen within a privatised SE to maintain co-existence between two different institutional logics, the social and commercial logics, to gain legitimacy in the government funding scheme. Design/methodology/approach: This study expands the application and contribution of the Besharov and Smith’s (2014) logics multiplicity framework to previous management accounting literature on PMS and institutional logics. It adds a new dimension to previous literature to theorise the cognitive dynamics of institutional logics at three distinct but interrelated institutional levels, namely, field, organisational and individual. Data come from an interpretive case study of an Egyptian SE, involved in implementing a social project (drinking water refining) in rural communities. Findings: PMS acts as a political tool through which the privatised case company has gained societal acceptance and legitimacy in the government funding scheme. Its non-political KPIs have turned into political tools to meet the institutional demands of the funding scheme. This government involvement represents field-level institutional logics, which influenced the organisational-level interplay of commercial and social logics and then the individual-level choice of internal KPIs. This contributes to the fact that institutional logics and their interplay between these three levels are “in a state of flux” within SEs’ internal PMS. Originality/value: This study deals with a real-life practical case that proves the prevalence of one institutional logic over another at both the organisational and individual levels may be occasioned by organisational field pressures and opportunities rather than by other intra-organisational conflicts as discussed in most previous literature on PMS and institutional logics.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/towards-understanding-how-the-hr-function-relates-to-the-accounti', 'Paper_Names': 'Towards Understanding How the HR Function Relates to the Accounting Function', 'Publication_Date': '13 Jan 2021', 'Author_Names': '  Simon Horsman ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/simon-horsman ', 'Abstract': 'Learning ObjectivesAt the end of this chapter, learners should be able to:- Identify and describe the main functions that fall within the activities labelled ‘accounting’ and ‘finance’ and relate these functions to one another.- Locate these functions within the structures typical of small and large organisations and relate these functions:(a)\\tto organisational success and failure and(b)\\tto other business functions.For each of the main class of decision made by human resource practitioners identify the information required and the ways in which this information is, in part, generated by the accounting and finance function.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/trade-wins-or-trade-wars-the-perceptions-and-knowledge-in-the-fre', 'Paper_Names': 'Trade Wins or Trade Wars: The Perceptions and Knowledge in the Free Trade Debate', 'Publication_Date': 'Jul 2021', 'Author_Names': '  Piotr Lis ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/piotr-lis ', 'Abstract': 'This book tackles the disconnect between social perceptions and expert knowledge regarding trade policy decisions.

The sector plays a significant role for the national economy due to its contribution to job creation, industrialization and economic growth. However, the sector has been widely criticized because of heavy work conditions and high rates of work accidents. The construction industry generally grows faster than GDP in expansion periods and shrinks more during the crisis years. While these fluctuations make the construction industry more unstable, they also affect its employees more negatively than the general economic course during recessions in construction activities. Workplace health and safety standards do not gain priority in a sectoral structure where small and medium-sized companies, subcontractors and contracting services are predominant. On the contrary, the existing structure negatively affects the work conditions and occupational health and safety in many respects. With the growth of the construction sector, while employment rates increase, the rates of occupational accidents, occupational diseases, permanent incapacity and death also go up. Dissatisfaction of the construction workers with the profession and the low prestige attributed to this line of work lead to high labor turnover rates across the sector. The widespread seasonal work in the construction sector as well as the employment of domestic and foreign migrant workers further lower down the labor standards.To fulfil its role in the development of Turkey sustainably and more importantly, to become a decent work area that values human rights, the construction industry needs to provide a more secure and safer work environment. Given the job and social insecurities and the low education of the workforce in general, the sector becomes trapped in a vicious cycle of low skill-low productivity, failing to initiate a sustainable growth pattern based on high value-added production. The sector will continue to show high sensitivity in the face of crises without raising the current work conditions to certain standards through an institutional restructuring. This study aims to identify problems regarding the existent work standards in the Turkish construction sector and to develop policy recommendations for improvement. To this end, in light of the findings obtained from the literature review, an overall assessment of the construction sector and the work conditions is made based on a descriptive analysis of secondary data at sector and firm levels that cover the post-2000 period. In the analysis, data from the Turkish Republic Presidency Strategy and Budget Directorate, TURKSTAT, CBRT and SGK are used. Policy recommendations for improving the workplace standards are developed to enhance the health, skill and job satisfaction of the workers and to achieve a sustainable growth path in the sector.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/understanding-public-sentiment-in-relation-to-the-african-contine', 'Paper_Names': 'Understanding Public Sentiment in Relation to the African Continental Free Trade Agreement', 'Publication_Date': '16 Jun 2021', 'Author_Names': '  Olubunmi Ajala ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/olubunmi-ajala ', 'Abstract': 'This study explores public sentiment in relation to the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) by analysing 18,481 tweets mentioning ACFTA over a three-month period.

The French Indochina War (FIW) from 1946-1954 furnishes useful insights with resonance for current infectious, climatic, pollution, economic and security challenges.  Five strategic themes structured an analysis of historical literature.  The reasons for the French failure in 1954 involved fundamental regime illegitimacy, political equivocation, intelligence shortcomings, strategic and operational failures but also the determination, strength and adaptability of the Việt Minh (VM).  In 1945, France had re-occupied Vietnam to re-assert its global credentials.  Later, Cold War logic and American aid sustained “La sale guerre”.  However, the conflict merely delayed and bloodied an inevitable post-colonial regime shift.  To maintain American aid flows yet retain French regional influence, the commander of the Expeditionary Corps, Henri Navarre, adopted an offensive stance.  He sought to crush the VM, breathe life into the moribund French Union (L’Union française) and block Giáp’s feints on Laos.  In November 1954, he inserted a fortified camp at remote Diên Biên Phú (DBP).  However, Navarre ignored the lessons of Hòa Bình (1950-51), Nghĩa Lộ (1951).  He misread Nà Sản (1952) and underestimated VM capabilities.  Operationally, the distance of DBP from Hanoi stretched the French aero-logistical system to its limits.  Navarre also diverted resources to sideshow – Opération Atlante.  Giáp realised Navarre had taken the bait and sealed off the besieged camp with five divisions, including an artillery one.  On 13th March, the VM attacked and conquered the garrison after 56 days on the evening of 7-8th May 1954.  Navarre’s gamble had spectacularly backfired.  Militarily, the French Expeditionary Corps might have recovered even considering the bloodbath at Mang Yang Pass almost seven weeks later.  However, the psychological blow unmasked regime financial and political bankruptcy.  Power drained away to the Americans or the communists.  Whilst French Indochina perpetuated an iniquitous social structure, tainted by racism, symbolic and physical violence, it arguably it also protected minorities, spurned dictatorship and transferred culture and technology.The most striking finding that emerges from this investigation is the incredible transformation of the geography of Vietnam since 1948.  Then, tigers and elephant roamed in jungles, 160km North West of Saigon, near Phan Thiết.  Today, suburbia encroaches on depleted coffee plantations and desiccated scrub.  Aside from concerns over the long-term ecological trajectories under anthropogenic pressures in ostensibly communist or capitalist inspired systems and, notwithstanding today’s very different context, the detailed investigation into aspects of the War provides strategic metaphors involving fiscal re-calibration, governance hierarchy or incentive regulations, hubristic corrections and ecological transformation'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/accounting-and-smart-cities-new-evidence-for-governmentality-and-', 'Paper_Names': 'Accounting and smart cities: New evidence for governmentality and politics', 'Publication_Date': '9 Apr 2020', 'Author_Names': '  Loai Alsaid ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/loai-alsaid ', 'Abstract': 'The concept of a smart city has attracted the attention of many scholars and policymakers in many countries worldwide.

Drawing on the concept of governmentality, the authors conducted a case study based on document analysis, meetings observation, and 42 semi-structured interviews at a branch of a hybrid electricity company owned by New Cairo City in Egypt, during 2018. Findings show that the case company has implemented smart distribution networks of electricity in which new management accounting technology (enterprise resource planning (ERP) system) is used to trace costs, revenues, client complaints and feedback in a timely manner. The new network (of infrastructure and technologies) has represented timely accounting information as a major political power to influence accurate governance decision-making, such as smart electricity pricing and control, and to challenge governance decisions that are not sound. This paper is one of the first studies to explore the socio-political dynamics of accounting in smart city governance in the context of LDCs.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/bathing-facilities-and-health-phronesis-tackling-english-obesity', 'Paper_Names': 'Bathing facilities and health phronesis: tackling English obesity', 'Publication_Date': '4 Jun 2020', 'Author_Names': '  Simon Huston  Simon Huston ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/simon-huston https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/simon-huston ', 'Abstract': 'The Coronavirus pandemic has raised questions about public health system fragility or lack of health phronesis (practical wisdom).

In this paper, new measures are proposed for calculating the relative importance of condition attributes based on the characteristics of decision rules and of attribute reducts. Decision rule-based measures are parameterised in order to consider the characteristics of decision rules using both learning and testing datasets. The proposed measures can be aggregated into a comprehensive measure indicating the overall importance of each condition attribute. Furthermore, the proposed measures are extended in order to compute the relative importance of a collection of condition attributes taken together. In addition, decision rule-based measures are extended to evaluate the relative importance of specific values of condition attributes.

We found that an exogenous lockdown significantly affects the number of confirmed cases after 7 days of its implementation and its lag effects are intact even after 21 days of its implementation.

This analysis was supplemented with estimating a fixed-effects and two-stage least squares regression models to address any concerns regarding the possible existence of endogeneity problems.FindingsThis study reports three key findings. First, the authors find that early ISAs adoption has a negative effect on several financial market consequences, namely stock market integration, market capitalisation, market turnover, market return, market development, stock price volatility and stock trading volume. Second, using an alternative measure to the one that is proposed by DOI theory, the authors found that some financial indicators have been significantly improved after ISAs adoption, but only for listed firms that prepared their financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards and audited by ISAs simultaneously. Finally, the financialindicators of European stock markets, however, have insignificantly shrank post the mandatory adoption of ISAs in 2006.Practical implicationsThe empirical evidence raises questions about how ISAs were enforced and implemented. For example, countries that adopted ISAs at early stages may have been dominated mostly by recently established stock exchanges. This implies a crucial need to determine and apply the best type of auditing regime that can increase investors trust and enhance the credibility of stock markets information, which might ultimately advance the FMIs over time significantly.Originality/valueTo-date, studies investigating the impact of the adoption of ISAs on FMI from a DOI theory perspective are virtually non-existent.

In a perfect market, with self-less management, aiming to maximise shareholder wealth, it may be expected that hedging would improve firm performance and add value. Our major contribution in this paper is that we first demonstrate theoretically the conditions under which hedging can increase or decrease firm value. Our theoretic model demonstrates that the ambiguous relationship between hedging and firm value may be due to a subtle combination of economic (managerial self-interest, agency problems/moral hazard, managerial ability, managerial risk aversion) and behavioural factors (overconfidence). Our empirical analysis confirms the ambiguous effect of hedging on firm performance. Empirically, we focus on the use of derivatives in the corporate hedging of three types of financial risk (foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks), and examine the effect on value and performance of listed UK corporations during 2005-2017. We demonstrate that the positive or negative effects of the hedging strategies varies significantly across both the financial risk that is hedged and the type of derivatives contracts used in the hedging as well as the time period in consideration.

Within this framework, banks are able to sell mortgages to a financial vehicle corporation, which finances its activity by creating mortgage-backed securities and selling them to a mutual fund. In turn, the mutual fund collects liquidity by selling shares to households and remunerates them with a monthly interest. The impact of this mechanism is analysed by means of computational experiments for different levels of banks’ securitisation propensity. Furthermore, we study a set of systemic risk indicators which have the aim of assessing the imbalances in the financial system. Two of them are the mortgage-to-GDP ratio and the capital adequacy ratio, which are constructed to detect only the on-balance sheet changes in banks’ credit exposure. We consider two additional indicators, similar to the previous ones with the only difference that they are also able to account for the off-balance sheet items. Moreover, we adopt an indicator, the so-called “virtuous–unvirtuous cycle” indicator, which, besides off-balance assets, targets also the GDP. The results show that higher securitisation propensity weakens the financial stability of banks with relevant effects on different sectors of the economy. Most importantly, the analysis of systemic risk reveals the important issue of designing suitable systemic risk indicators for predicting incoming financial crises, finding that an essential feature of these indicators should be to integrate banks’ off-balance sheet assets.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/it-is-not-what-you-think-the-effect-of-colonial-legacies-on-afric', 'Paper_Names': 'The effect of colonial legacies on Africa’s inward FDI: the Case of UK FDI in Ghana', 'Publication_Date': '3 Feb 2020', 'Author_Names': '  Maktoba Omar ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/maktoba-omar-omar-saad ', 'Abstract': 'Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the role colonial ties play in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ghana, several years after the official end of colonisation in the African continent. Colonisation left behind legacies of institutional framework, social ties and remnants of companies of colonial masters, which could potentially offer contemporary businesses from home countries the benefits of country of origin agglomeration. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses sequential explanatory mixed research design through 101 questionnaires and 8 interviews from the UK companies with FDI in Ghana. This approached enabled the initial quantitative results to be explored further through the qualitative data. Findings: Colonial ties have limited influence on contemporary flow of FDI to Ghana, in spite of the institutional legacies between former colonisers and colonies. Majority of UK companies are influenced by agglomeration opportunities in general rather than country of origin agglomeration. However, country of origin agglomeration remains important to over a third of the companies surveyed. Research limitations/implications: The sample was taken from the non-extractive industry in Ghana, and caution must be applied in generalising the findings. However, some universal issues concerning agglomeration and institutions are discussed. Originality/value: Although there has been some research on colonial history and its impact on FDI in Africa, existing knowledge on bilateral relations is rather limited. Unlike previous studies, this research provides depth by examining colonial influence on FDI between two countries, using two key concepts: country of origin agglomeration and institutions. It provides UK companies with contemporary views to consider when exploring FDI opportunities in Ghana, particularly in relation to the effects of the colonial history. It also provides investment promotion agencies with empirical results on the importance of various forms of agglomeration and institutions for FDI attraction.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-fiscal-regime-for-uk-shale-gas-analysing-the-impacts-of-pad-a', 'Paper_Names': 'The Fiscal Regime for UK Shale Gas: Analysing the Impacts of Pad Allowance on Shale Gas Investments', 'Publication_Date': '1 Sep 2020', 'Author_Names': '  Elijah Acquah-Andoh  Andrews Owusu  Elijah Acquah-Andoh  Andrews Owusu ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/elijah-acquah-andoh https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/andrews-owusu https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/elijah-acquah-andoh https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/andrews-owusu ', 'Abstract': \"The UK is believed to hold prolific reserves of shale gas; the quality of which has been compared and sometimes branded superior to the much successful US shale plays. Nonetheless, after more than ten years since the 13th Onshore Licensing Round, the fracking industry is said to have benefited from just £400 million - £500 million of estimated investments and only one partially fracked well with yet an uncertain fate of commercial production. This paradox motivated the current research. Based on a discounted cash flow model, the economic feasibility of the tax regime was evaluated with a  special interest in the pad allowance [PA], a major incentive of the fiscal regime. We find that the design of the fiscal regime well achieves the Government's financial objectives, but fails to support shale gas investments at lower gas prices. PA introduces further variability in investor cash flows, ultimately defeating the ethos of the incentive. We propose a reduction in the overall tax rate from 40% to no more than 21%; a removal of the additional tax charge (Supplementary Charge) and an amendment of PA rules to; (1) allow an extension of RFES to PA; (2) permit transfer of activated PA across companies in the same group; and (3) redefine capital expenditure to include intermediate well retirement costs necessary to drill new wells to stimulate production. Such a tax strategy would simplify and align the UK fiscal regime with practices across the US, China, Algeria and Canada. Importantly, it would better match the risk of shale gas investments to its rewards and could better attract investments. We recommend the strategy for emerging unconventional oil and gas producing countries for an efficient design of their fiscal regimes.\"}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-impact-of-profit-sharing-investment-accounts-on-shareholders-', 'Paper_Names': \"The Impact of Profit-Sharing Investment Accounts on Shareholders' Wealth\", 'Publication_Date': '24 Sep 2020', 'Author_Names': '  Ken Baldwin ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/ken-baldwin ', 'Abstract': 'This study evaluates the impact of profit-sharing investment accounts (PSIAs) on shareholders’ wealth.

Consequently, the IFSB methodology precludes bank-specific alphas linked to the actual risk profile of underlying assets. There is also no discernible mapping between alpha and a bank's own propensity to subsidise cash returns. This paper instead develops a new theoretical model for bank-specific alpha that is estimated for 43 Islamic banks in 11 countries. Our alpha values broadly correspond with those of the IFSB. However, a form of regulatory arbitrage is shown to exist which favors banks with relatively high alphas.

We find that a combination of 5 years straight line depreciation (SLD), 5% First Tranche Petroleum (FTP), 78% Contractor Share (CS) and 35% income tax best spreads the risk of CBM development and exploitation between the government and the contractor. This combination is a more suitable PSC regime for developing CBM in an early stage of the industry. Therefore, the Government must cede some taxes during exploration to incentivise CBM development. Three PSCs regimes are thus required to fully develop and exploit CBM, including exploration, transitional and exploitation phase PSCs which better match contractor risks and returns and ensure reasonable certainty of contractor cost recovery.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/common-risk-factors-in-returns-on-sukuk-investment', 'Paper_Names': 'Common Risk Factors in Returns on Sukuk Investment', 'Publication_Date': '2019', 'Author_Names': '  Sarkar Kabir ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/sarkar-kabir ', 'Abstract': 'The global interest in sukuk, an Islamic alternative to bond financing, has grown rapidly, particularly after the 2008 global financial crisis, due to its distinctive features and investment quality. Sukuk were first launched in Malaysia and are presently available in 29 countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Luxembourg. Despite the global market prevalence of sukuk, asset pricing literature has not yet addressed the pricing mechanism of sukuk, which is inherently different from bonds and equity due to the contractual differences. However, analysts use LIBOR, or the Islamic interbank benchmark rate (IIBR), as the ad-hoc benchmark to evaluate sukuk performance. In this study, we develop a basic pricing model that captures the common risks in sukuk returns. We identify two risk factors for sukuk that require risk premiums: (i) sukuk market risk and (ii) information asymmetry risk. Using these two common sukuk risk factors, investment analysts can estimate the fair value of sukuk more precisely than other ad hoc measures available.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/competing-institutional-logics-and-institutional-embeddedness-of-', 'Paper_Names': 'Competing institutional logics and institutional embeddedness of actors in Islamic financial reporting standardisation: A comparative study', 'Publication_Date': '2019', 'Author_Names': '  Ahmad Abras ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/ahmad-abras ', 'Abstract': 'NA'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/compliance-with-mercury-reporting-provisions-under-the-minamata-c', 'Paper_Names': 'Compliance with Mercury Reporting Provisions under the Minamata Convention: An Assessment from a Developing Country Perspective', 'Publication_Date': '2019', 'Author_Names': '  Hafij Ullah ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/hafij-ullah ', 'Abstract': 'NA'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/corporate-environmental-accountability-in-nigeria-the-role-of-loc', 'Paper_Names': 'Corporate environmental accountability in Nigeria: The role of local communities', 'Publication_Date': '25 Nov 2019', 'Author_Names': '  Abdurafiu Noah ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/abdurafiu-noah ', 'Abstract': 'NA'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/corporate-environmental-accountability-in-nigeria-the-role-of-loc-2', 'Paper_Names': 'Corporate environmental accountability in Nigeria: the role of Local Community', 'Publication_Date': '11 Sep 2019', 'Author_Names': '  Abdurafiu Noah ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/abdurafiu-noah ', 'Abstract': 'NA'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/corporate-governance-and-business-growth-evidence-from-china', 'Paper_Names': 'Corporate governance and business growth: Evidence from China', 'Publication_Date': '2019', 'Author_Names': '  Christopher Muganhu ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/christopher-muganhu ', 'Abstract': 'The implementation of an effective system of corporate governance is now of critical importance to China’s drive for economic growth.

Further, we perform an empirical analysis of its role in business growth by examining mergers and acquisitions taking place in China, presenting evidence to show how its practice has influenced value creation and company growth, providing significant insights into the problems and prospects of corporate governance in China today. Overall, our study highlights the need for the government to accelerate the reform of the ownership structure, so as to give managers incentives to maximise company value. Ultimately, it is imperative to install and maintain an effective corporate governance mechanism, under which board independence is real and not merely decorative, and directors’ decision-making is guided and constrained by sound and transparently applied principles.Our findings clearly indicate the extent to which China’s system of corporate governance has so far failed to achieve its objectives, and in what ways it must be reformed and developed in order to enhance market credibility, enterprise competitiveness and economic growth. Our evidence will be of value to China in policy development and practice, as well as to other economies that have pursued, or will pursue, similar trajectories.

The study based on eight years' data for 455 banks and 137 insurance firms from 28 countries finds that insurance firms have a low-quality corporate board as compared to banks. The reasons include: Insurance firms, in comparison to banks, are less likely to have an audit committee and infrequently meeting if they have an audit committee, high existence of CEO duality and involvement in the nomination committees, long-serving CEOs, gender imbalance in the board, fewer independent directors, and higher percentage of directors' ownership. The findings persist across all subsamples except that insurance companies operating in highly corrupt countries have a superior quality board in contrast to a bank.

Using a large sample of UK firms from the FTSE All-Share Index over the 2003–2011 period, we show a positive correlation between the presence of compensation consultants and CEO pay. Importantly, isolating this effect is somewhat dependent on the endogenous selection of consultants and the statistical modelling strategy deployed. We find evidence that compensation consultants improve CEO compensation design when their expertise is of greater importance (e.g. during the post-financial crisis period, or for firms that have particularly weak compensation policies). In addition, our findings show that compensation consultants increase CEO pay–performance sensitivity. The balance of evidence supports optimal contracting theory more than managerial power theory, but the authors caution the limits to this verification. We are careful to note that the more compelling evidence for the positive effect of pay consultants on CEOs is based on advanced methods (such as propensity score matching and difference-in-differences), and that more standard approaches (such as OLS and fixed effects) are unlikely to reveal the same level of causality of consultants on CEO pay.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/do-disclosure-and-transparency-affect-banks-financial-performance', 'Paper_Names': 'Do disclosure and transparency affect bank’s financial performance?', 'Publication_Date': '9 Aug 2019', 'Author_Names': '  Isaiah Oino ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/isaiah-oino ', 'Abstract': 'Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of transparency and disclosure on the financial performance of financial institutions. The emphasis is on assessing transparency and disclosure; auditing and compliance; risk management as indicators of corporate governance; and understanding how these parameters affect bank profitability, liquidity and the quality of loan portfolios. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 20 financial institutions was selected, with ten respondents from each, yielding a total sample size of 200. Principal component analysis (PCA), with inbuilt ability to check for composite reliability, was used to obtain composite indices for the corporate governance indicators as well as the indicators of financial performance, based on a set of questions framed for each institution. Findings: The analysis demonstrates that greater disclosure and transparency, improved auditing and compliance and better risk management positively affect the financial performance of financial institutions. In terms of significance, the results show that as the level of disclosure and transparency in managerial affairs increases, the performance of financial institutions – as measured in terms of the quality of loan portfolios, liquidity and profitability – increases by 0.3046, with the effect being statistically significant at the 1 per cent level. Furthermore, as the level of auditing and the degree of compliance with banking regulations increases, the financial performance of banks improves by 0.3309. Research limitations/implications: This paper did not consider time series because corporate governance does not change periodically.

The impact of the share of employees with higher education, provision of on-the-job training, years of experience of the top manager and labour cost on export intensity is assessed. To test these relationships, Tobit and Fractional Logit approaches are adopted. The estimation results suggest that, overall, having a more educated workforce exerts a positive impact on the export intensity of firms in transition economies, the magnitude being larger for CEECs. Average labour cost, as an alternative measure, also turns out to exert a positive but stronger impact. Insufficient evidence is found of a role for training programmes and years of experience of the top manager.

The conceptual analysis shows how Islamic banking helps to improve the quality of bank assets by instituting a partnership or non-partnership contract in the banking business on the one hand, and escalates the cost of banking operations on the other side due to the additional operational hurdles, which triggers higher earnings uncertainty in Islamic banking than in conventional banking. The global evidence from 23 countries confirms that, due to the high operational costs, the earnings of Islamic banks are more uncertain even though they perform well in loan operations. Therefore, we conclude Islamic banking trades-off between the reduction of credit risk and escalation of business risk.

From policy perspectives, our results suggest that output adjustments may not play a significant role in reducing emissions. We find the overall effects of changes in energy demand to be moderate.

Design/methodology/approach: Acquirers’ systematic risk (beta) is calculated using the capital asset pricing model. The change in acquirers’ beta post-merger is obtained using event study and tested for mean differences across various sub-categories of deals. Cross-sectional regressions are then performed to test several hypotheses relating to the impact of diversification, method of payment, target status and prior experience on acquirers’ risk. Findings: For the overall sample, the evidence suggests that acquirers’ beta tends to increase post-merger, but only in cases where their pre-merger risk is relatively low in relation to the risk of the market. The authors also show that cash payment deals for publicly listed targets contribute to reducing acquirers’ risk while stock payment increase risk. Diversification, whether global or across industry, has no significant impact on risk. On the other hand, for serial acquirers, the risk is increased significantly with more M&As. Originality/value: This study contributes in a unique way by providing global evidence on acquirers’ systematic risk using a very large and diverse sample of M&A deals and investigating not only the impact of diversification on risk but also of other deal characteristics (e.g. method of payment, target status, acquirers’ prior experience) which have not been previously examined.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/multi-academy-trusts-in-england-a-scenario-of-cooperation-with-un', 'Paper_Names': 'Multi Academy Trusts in England: A scenario of cooperation with universities', 'Publication_Date': '7 May 2019', 'Author_Names': '  R.M.

We also find that the positive relationship between SOBC expense and shareholder returns over the financial crisis is more pronounced when ownership is more concentrated.

This chapter provides in-depth insights into the best market practices for stress testing framework for the survival of Islamic financial markets and institutions in the face of possible market shocks, within a sophisticated financial market in Europe. This subject is important for two reasons: firstly, the survival of an Islamic financial market and its institutions is hugely dependent on its risk factors and stress testing management approaches. Secondly, the ability of managing such market shocks without compromising Shari’ah requirements is a very important component for Islamic financial institutions (IFIs).

While the concept of ‘space’ is open to interpretation, in the context of this study it is viewed from two perspective: firstly, the individual entrepreneurial universities as discrete spaces and secondly, the regional context of the West Midland as an overall shared space inhabited by MSMEs. The distances between these spaces is often mediate through various policy initiatives, which aim to create economic sustainability (Marrewijk 2003, Pojasek 2007, Samujh 2011) and growth in the region through its MSMEs (Martins & Mawson 1980, Gibbs 2000, Lundstrum et al 2014). This research explores the effectiveness and impact of policy as a mechanism for mediation and the viability of policy as a mechanism for ongoing sustainability and growth (Ham & Hill 1993, Hart 2003, Huggins & Williams 2009). \\n\\nAims\\n\\nThis research aimed to determine if a model of sustainable business support could be developed for MSMEs that is not dependent on ‘public’ funding as a keystone. This paper examines the national and regional business support agenda; the support needs of MSMEs; the role of universities (or HEIs) in the provision of business support, and the needs of public funding bodies with regards to economic sustainability and growth of MSMEs in the West Midlands.\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nThis interpretivist study utilises semi-structured interviews with key post holders from West Midland’s universities. Four universities were identified for participation in the study. They were selected to achieve a representative mixture of university classifications and geographical spread across the region. Individual participants were a representative blend of leaders (Vice of Deputy Vice Chancellor), senior managers (Pro-Vice Chancellor) and managers. The aim was to conduct sixteen interviews, (comprised of four per institution), however an unobjectionable minimum of two was considered acceptable. In addition, secondary data was drawn from publicly available reports, publications and the institutions’ websites.   Through this understanding, the research produced a series of outcomes and identifiable trends, which in turn facilitated the creation of the conceptual model for business support, which is focus of this paper. \\n\\nContribution\\n\\nThe research demonstrates that funding is a ‘keystone’ of the support system across the region and it proposes a range of options to support providers, governments and the MSME community in order to address and re-balance the current in-balance in funding provision. It highlighted systemic challenges within the tripartite relationship between Business, Universities, and Governments (also referred to as the triple helix). A key finding is noticeably lack of underpinning research by the support providers themselves who tended to focus only on data that supported their bids. There is a lack of flexibility in public funding to address the bespoke needs for the MSME owners (see also Devins et al 2005).  There is a lack of dedicated, long term, enterprise strategy within the HEIs to ensure sustainability, rather there is a short term focus on policy and economic stimulus interventions which result in fragmented support.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/to-what-extent-do-public-and-private-financing-sources-affect-acc', 'Paper_Names': 'To what extent do public and private financing sources affect access and quality of health care?

Henceforth goal 3.8 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals defines the priority areas to achieve UHC goals – equity in the use of health services, quality of care and financial protection, by 2030. Consequently, the key functions of a health financing system – revenue raising, pooling and purchasing, are at the core of a country’s progress towards achieving UHC. The World Health Organisation has argued that in order to provide access to good quality health care services for all members of the population, the health financing system should avoid catastrophic health expenditure caused by large out-of-pocket payments and user fees; they dampen demand and create barriers to access especially for the poor. Typically, in Uganda, domestic private health expenditure is the dominant source of health sector financing contributing more than 50% of the total current health expenditure, with 40% as household out-of-pocket payments. We employed an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to estimate the relationship between health care financing sources and health outcomes using a health access and quality index as a proxy for health outcome. In our analysis, we posited that preventable (treatable) causes of death are a good measure of access to healthcare and quality of healthcare in the health system. We constructed a healthcare access and quality index based on three health indicators: Under-five mortality, DPT3 coverage, and Immunization against measles in Uganda, using the principal component analysis method. The index ranges between 0 and 100 whereby moving towards 100 signifies increasing level of health care access and quality. The study finds that an increase in the ratio of private to government health care financing has different impacts in the short run and long run. While in the short-run it increases access and quality of health care, in the long run it reduces access and quality of health care.  The findings suggest that reliance on private health care financing is not sustainable in the long run, if the country is to achieve the universal health coverage goals by 2030. Therefore, government ought to increase its share of health care financing to avoid the negative impact of relying on private health care financing in the long run.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/understanding-time-inconsistent-heterogeneous-preferences-in-econ', 'Paper_Names': 'Understanding time-inconsistent heterogeneous preferences in economics and finance: A practice theory approach', 'Publication_Date': '31 Mar 2018', 'Author_Names': '  Panos Andrikopoulos  Panagiotis Andrikopoulos ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/panagiotis-andrikopoulos https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/panagiotis-andrikopoulos ', 'Abstract': 'This paper introduces an innovative framework for decision making by individuals with inconsistent preferences.

The study considered IBBL as the only sample because it is the only Islamic bank in Bangladesh which is the member of both AAOIFI and IFSB. Hence, this paper investigated the compliancestatus of IBBL as a member of AAOIFI and IFSB. The study examined the annual reports of 2008-2012 as these were the latest and contemporary reports in 2013 when the study was conducted. SPSS software version 22.0 was used to analyze the data. A total of 203 items under 13 categories of AAOIFI standard and 133 items under 17 categories of IFSB standard were considered. Ordinary least squares was run to test the hypotheses of the study.Findings – The study found that IBBL on an average complied 46.31 per cent of AAOIFI and 52.50 per cent of IFSB standards during the period, and importantly, IBBL did not comply some of the categories of required disclosures. The study also observed that size, as measured by total asset and number of branches, has a significant influence on compliance with IFSB standard, but not AAOIFI. The findings of the study depicted that IBBL did not reasonably recognize the importance of complying with AAOIFI and IFSB standards. Poor compliance or non-compliance with AAOIFI and IFSB accounting and reporting standards by IBBL exposed that the bank is not efficient in managing Shari`ah compliance risks, operational risks and transparent financial reporting. Therefore, recognition of the Shari`ah standards by the respective IFIs and a “regulatorypush” is vital for improving the level of compliance with these standards.Research limitations/implications – The study considered IBBL as the only sample of the study because it is the only Islamic bank in Bangladesh which holds the membership of both AAOIFI and IFSB. The fiscal years 2008-2012 only were selected to evaluate the compliance status of the AAOIFI and IFSB standards in preparation and presentation of the financial statements of IBBL for comparative analysis because IFSB standard for accounting and disclosure was formulated in 2007; hence, the study could not evaluate the compliance status before 2008.Practical implications – The study will help IBBL in identifying their limitations in complying AAOIFI and IFSB standards and also the regulators in designing the accounting and reporting frameworks in regulating Islamic banks in Bangladesh. The study would help IBBL in identifying the reasons for noncompliance,how improvement in compliance level may help the bank in mitigating Shari`ah compliance and operational risk and how new legal and institutional framework may improve the level of compliance with those standards.Social implications – The study observed that the AAOIFI and IFSB standards were set for increasing the level of Shari`ah compliance, but the compliance status showed that different classes of accounting and reporting were ignored from compliance by IBBL. This study will benefit the stakeholders in choosing aShari`ah-compliant bank.Originality/value – This is a unique study which considered both AAOIFI and IFSB accounting and reporting standards in evaluating the reporting compliance status of an Islamic bank and identified the influence of reporting compliance on managing Shari`ah compliance risks, operational risks and transparency. This study expects to instigate the Islamic banks in complying accounting and reporting standards for being Shari`ah-compliant.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/competing-institutional-logics-in-islamic-financial-reporting-sta', 'Paper_Names': 'Competing Institutional Logics in Islamic Financial Reporting Standardisation: A Comparative Study ', 'Publication_Date': '1 Jan 2018', 'Author_Names': '  Ahmad Abras ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/ahmad-abras ', 'Abstract': \"Recognising the accounting implications of Islamic business principles, initiatives have been taken to develop a framework that primarily aims to serve the financial reporting needs of Islamic financial industry. Those initiatives started with the objective of developing separate Islamic accounting standards. However, they have ended up with significantly heterogeneous objectives. Employing Institutional Logics Perspective (ILP) as a theoretical framework and case-study approach as a research design, this study provides comparative accounts into the role of selected institutional logics (religion, profession, market, community and state) in shaping two Islamic financial reporting standardisation projects initiated by the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) and the Malaysian Accounting Standard Board (MASB). Moreover, utilising ILP supplemented by remarks from the institutional entrepreneurship concept, this study examines the role of actors in initiating and then differently shaping the standardisation policies of these projects. Research findings informed by semi-structured interviews and document analysis indicate that Islamic financial reporting standardisation projects have been historically mapped by certain institutional logics. The dominance of those logics has experienced significant changes over time, resulting in subsequent changes in the standardisation strategies of those projects. Influential actors have also played an important role in shaping those projects through promoting certain organisational strategies in line with the institutional logics in which they are embedded This study concludes that the heterogeneity which AAOFI and MASB have shown in their standardisation strategies is attributed to: the relative dominance of certain logics in each institutional context; the centrality of those logics to organisational mission and goals; the extent to which prevailing institutional logics are represented within the organisation and the balance of power between different logics' representatives; and the extent to which actors have been able to promote their entrepreneurial vision and mobilise allies behind it.\"}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/corporate-governance-and-audit-quality-further-recommendations-be', 'Paper_Names': 'Corporate Governance and Audit Quality: Further Recommendations Beyond the Code', 'Publication_Date': '26 Jan 2018', 'Author_Names': '  Salem Alhababsah  Salem Alhababsah ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/salem-alhababsah https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/salem-alhababsah ', 'Abstract': 'Although meeting the recommendations of corporate governance code is important, it is not sufficient to ensure the governance effectiveness (often having more form than substance).

As a minimum, one would need to find evidence on PHH to question the validity of the Porter Hypothesis. A fully legitimate test of the Porter Hypothesis should, inter alia, have a particular emphasis on the impact of well-designed environmental policies on high-value sectors of an economy. Examining the recent empirical literature on the PHH we find that the evidence remains inconclusive.

Colonisation left behind legacies of institutional framework, social ties and remnants of companies of colonial masters, which could potentially offer contemporary businesses from home countries the benefits of country of origin agglomeration. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses sequential explanatory mixed research design through 101 questionnaires and 8 interviews from the UK companies with FDI in Ghana. This approached enabled the initial quantitative results to be explored further through the qualitative data. Findings: Colonial ties have limited influence on contemporary flow of FDI to Ghana, in spite of the institutional legacies between former colonisers and colonies. Majority of UK companies are influenced by agglomeration opportunities in general rather than country of origin agglomeration. However, country of origin agglomeration remains important to over a third of the companies surveyed. Research limitations/implications: The sample was taken from the non-extractive industry in Ghana, and caution must be applied in generalising the findings. However, some universal issues concerning agglomeration and institutions are discussed. Originality/value: Although there has been some research on colonial history and its impact on FDI in Africa, existing knowledge on bilateral relations is rather limited. Unlike previous studies, this research provides depth by examining colonial influence on FDI between two countries, using two key concepts: country of origin agglomeration and institutions. It provides UK companies with contemporary views to consider when exploring FDI opportunities in Ghana, particularly in relation to the effects of the colonial history.

Results showed that spatial variation of the groundwater depth in the study area was medium, but the variation coefficient of groundwater depth showed the seasonal changes. The spatial variation coefficient was largest in the dry season; the other months were relatively stable. The groundwater depth in the study area had strong temporal stability.

It uses an unbalanced panel of 300 microfinance institutions (MFIs) from 107 developing countries from 2005 to 2015. Three key trends emerge from the results of a 2SLS regression. First, the adoption of formal microbanking practices raises interest rates compared with other forms of microlending. Second, large‐scale lending lowers interest rates only for those MFIs that already hold legal banking status. Third, age of operation in excess of 8 years exerts a negative impact on interest rates, regardless of scale and charter type of MFI. Collectively, our results indicate that policies that incentivize mature MFIs to share their knowledge will be more effective in helping the nascent institutions to overcome their cost disadvantages compared with reforms to transform them into licensed banks. For MFIs that already hold permits to operate as banks, initiatives to increase loan sizes are key strategic pricing decisions, irrespective of the institution's age. This study is original in its differentiation of the impact on interest rates of regulations that promote formal banking principles, credit market extension vis‐à‐vis knowledge sharing between mature and nascent MFIs.\"}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-development-of-accounting-practices-and-the-adoption-of-ifrs-', 'Paper_Names': 'The development of accounting practices and the adoption of IFRS in selected MENA countries', 'Publication_Date': '2018', 'Author_Names': '  Masud Ibrahim ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/masud-ibrahim ', 'Abstract': 'PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine the level of accounting development and the adoption of IFRS in the four foremost economies in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)—Egypt, Jordan, Libya and UAE.

This paper considered the likely positive economic effects of the supply chain management on China’s automobile industries. Firstly, the supply chain tends to open more markets for China’s automotive industries in the ASEAN, EU, and AU regions. Secondly, the supply chain threatens China’s automobile industries control over her local and regional markets from foreign automobile industries as China open their markets  for international automobile industries in order to penetrate into foreign automobile markets.

Multilateral donors are also less likely to include a conflict-ridden country on a recipient list. Domestic terrorism increases bilateral aid, but this effect appears to be entirely driven by assistance from the United States, arguably a terrorist prime-target country.

A multi-factor CAPM model is developed within a DCC-MGARCH framework to estimate time-varying Beta. We find that this reacts in different ways to different contagion events. It rose by a statistically significant 0.058 (an 8% increase) in response to the euro-zone crisis. However, with the exception of South Africa, the 2007–09 crisis was found to have no significant impact on Beta.

We use a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model to capture the lagged health and healthcare effects. We find that increasing the health share in the general government budget generates higher growth rates in GDP, investment and private consumption, and accelerates poverty reduction in Uganda, leading to increased health, strengthening the case for policy-makers in low- and middle-income countries to frontload investment in healthcare.

However, the results reveal a subtle role for technology transfer through the complementary effect of trade on FDI, and FDI on government expenditure, which henceforth influences human capital development with spillovers into domestic investment and growth.

Environmental pollution arising from corporate operations has been a major concern among transnational organisations (e.g. World Bank, IMF), governments, policymakers and society. Over the past two or more decades, environmental issues have taken on a more significant role in business decisions, corporate planning and global politics (Boutros-Ghali, 1992; Gray et al., 2014). Environmental issues have certainly deserved attention from academia so that research could be undertaken to understand and address the problems (see Freeman, 1984; Strong, 1992; Callan and Thomas, 2000; Darabaris, 2008). There have been various pieces of research on corporate environmental accounting, however their focus has principally been on issues in developed countries (e.g. Buhr and Freedman, 1996; O’Dwyer, 2005; Gray 2010). Developing and emerging economies are in fact creating significant amounts of environmental pollution on a daily basis due to their industrial development (UNEP, 2011; World Bank, 2014; WHO, 2014). Among others, Nigeria has been identified as one such country, with a high level of environmental pollution that contributes significantly to global environmental problems (Adeoti, 2001; UNEP, 2011; Yale, 2012). In the same vein, corporations in Nigeria have been found to be a key contributor for this problem. While corporations should be held accountable for their impacts on the environment, the political, economic and social context in Nigeria have all made corporate environmental accounting a challenge to be achieved. This highlights the need for more research in this area in order to enhance our knowledge on corporate environmental accounting issues in a developing country such as Nigeria, as well as potentially to initiate discussions on how to resolve corporate environmental problems. Most studies in Nigeria have looked at the impacts of environmental issues with no research focused on the management and reporting of environmental issues by corporations in the country and in particular, the cement industry (up to the time when this thesis was written). Therefore, this thesis examined how corporations in particular cement companies have been managing, accounting and reporting environmental issues generated by their operational activities in Nigeria. In order to achieve the purpose of the thesis, it has been necessary to adopt a subjectivity ontology and interpretive epistemology, which entails the use of qualitative perspectives. The study chose a case study approach (two companies were selected to be the case studies) and collected empirical data using a combination of semi-structured interviews, visual techniques and documentary analysis. Unlike most studies in Nigeria that have used the survey questionnaire approach (Owolabi, 2008; Ngwakwe, 2009; Oba et al., 2012; Hassan and Kouhy, 2013), this thesis will provide a more insightful qualitative view on corporate environmental accounting practices in Nigeria. The study also relied on convergent institutional and resource dependence theories as conceptualised by Oliver (1991) to provide a better understanding of CEIs management and reporting in the two chosen cases in particular and Nigeria as whole. The research found that the cement industry was a key environmental polluter in Nigeria, and that companies were under pressure from a number of agents to reduce environmental pollution. It further showed that environmental accountability practices in the Nigerian cement sector are largely influenced by the external institutional environment/factors, and that environmental accountability practices have become more a means of ensuring legitimacy with no significant impact on the wellbeing of citizens and the environment. It also demonstrated that the case studies adopted certain strategies in confronting the challenges from external institutions. Finally, the study contributes to the existing literature on social and environmental accounting research, especially from an emerging countries perspective. The findings from the research will also have theoretical and practical policy implications in Nigeria and the world at large.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/accounting-standards-complexity-audit-fees-and-financial-analyst-', 'Paper_Names': 'Accounting Standards Complexity, Audit Fees and Financial Analyst Forecasts in Australia', 'Publication_Date': '24 Nov 2017', 'Author_Names': '  Muhammad Shahin Miah ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/muhammad-shahin-miah ', 'Abstract': \"While the beneficial effects of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on financial reporting quality, cost of capital, cross-country investment, corporate decision making and governance are well studied in the literature, there is relatively little research on the cost side of IFRS adoption and its impact on users. This thesis contributes by investigating the impact of IFRS complexity on two important groups of users of financial reports namely auditors and financial analysts. The hypotheses are built on the premise that principles-based standards are more complex than rules-based standards. This study examines the relationships between IFRS complexity, audit fees, and analyst forecast properties. IFRS is likely to require more of auditors in terms of professional expertise, time and effort, hence resulting in higher audit fees. Financial analysts may be similarly affected by the complexity of IFRS resulting in less accurate forecasts on key financial components. This thesis measures IFRS complexity based on individual IFRS standards specifically identified as having higher levels of complexity. Scores are then calculated to indicate the difference between these IFRS standards and their equivalent previous domestic accounting standards. The degree of complexity is also measured at aggregate level to indicate an overall complexity impact based on the combined score for all identified 'complex' IFRS standards. Findings indicate that aggregate IFRS complexity is positively and significantly associated with audit fees but that specific IFRS standards are identifiable as being paiticularly complex, hence explaining much of the positive relationship with audit fees. The results also reveal that the incremental effect of IFRS complexity on audit fees is more pronounced when finns are audited by city-level industly specialists as opposed to those audited by non\\xadindustly specialists. Furthermore, IFRS complexity is found to have a positive and significant association with analyst forecast properties (forecast errors, forecast dispersion, and forecast revision). Surprisingly some of the standards identified as being more complex for auditors (i.e., driving higher audit fees) do not appear similarly complex in relation to financial analyst forecast properties. Finally, this thesis investigates the moderating role of high quality audits (proxied by industry specialist auditors) on complexity and analyst forecast properties and finds that forecast errors decrease for firms which are exposed to higher levels of IFRS complexity if they are audited by city-level industry specialists. This study provides important insights for regulator regarding the complexity of specific IFRS standards. Findings may also be of benefit to countries which are in the process of adopting IFRS or planning to do so.\"}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/a-distance-learning-university-and-its-economic-impact-in-a-count-2', 'Paper_Names': 'A distance learning university and its economic impact in a country’s peripheries: the case of Hellenic Open University', 'Publication_Date': '24 Dec 2015', 'Author_Names': '  Dimitrios Serenis  Dimitris Serenis ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/dimitris-serenis https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/dimitris-serenis ', 'Abstract': 'Higher education institutions can contribute into regional growth via the services of teaching they provide, the research activity they develop and the administration spillover effects on the local markets they operate. This paper attempts to quantify the impact of university expenditures on the regionally produced product (GDP). More specifically, we focus on the expenditure effects of the Hellenic Open University on the GDP of the 13 Greek regions. In our analysis we distinguish between direct and indirect effects by identifying as direct effects all initial expenditures incurred by the HOU while we identify and subsequently calculate as indirect effects the increases in local output caused by the interactions of different sectors of the regional economy. For the calculation of indirect effects we use the input–output methodology. An input–output system shows the intermediate transactions between sectors and the primary inputs, as well as, the final demand of each sector. This is a general equilibrium system that records all the inter-sector transactions presenting a complete picture of the economy under examination and being the appropriate system to be used for calculating the total effect of university expenditure on regional GDP. Our results suggest that the economic impact of HOU is (a) significant to the Greek peripheries and its size varies across regions; (b) indirect regional effects boost the direct regional effects by 60 % creating an overall size of the HOU expenses GDP multiplier by 1.6 on average. Moreover, our findings may have two straightforward policy implications that could be useful to those exercising policy making: first, the quantification of HOU economic impact on all Greek peripheries is not only useful for assessing the economic role of HOU at regional level but it could also been seen as a benchmark in assessing the impact of other similar regional educational activities. Secondly, the economic impact of HOU in each periphery can be a useful tool in assessing alternative non-educational, regional projects, aiming to fight the high unemployment arisen due to economic crisis that bedevils Greece and its peripheries in the last 5 years.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/an-extra-7-years-before-im-debt-free-the-effect-of-the-poverty-pr', 'Paper_Names': 'An extra 7 years before I’m debt free: The effect of the poverty premium on debt advice service users', 'Publication_Date': '2017', 'Author_Names': '  Nikhil Sapre ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/nikhil-sapre ', 'Abstract': 'NA'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/are-serial-acquirers-good-targets-for-acquisition-an-accounting-p-2', 'Paper_Names': 'Are serial acquirers good targets for acquisition?

We measure the intensity of economic ties with three variables: bilateral trade flows between the partner country and the US as well as FDI and aid flows from the US to the partner country.

It explores the nexus between primary food production, urban food and waste and outlined strategies to produce a more holistic food system. The chapter investigates the notion of 'urban consciousness' and its relationship with 'smart cities', and quality of life. It investigates issues around urban megaprojects in smart development. Some megaprojects radically transform but others backfire and waste resources or damage the environment. The indicative link between smart cities and university ranks, and extensive econometric evidence suggest that universities are central to smart cities. To manage development pressures and improve resource allocation, smart cities need reliable information systems.\"}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/construction-firms-competitiveness', 'Paper_Names': 'Construction Firms’ Competitiveness', 'Publication_Date': '14 Sep 2017', 'Author_Names': '  Simon Huston ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/simon-huston ', 'Abstract': 'Chapter 8 examines the role of construction firms as horizontal contracting insti - tutions for smart development.

The extant literature shows that environmental problems and the scale of consequences vary across developing and developed countries (Yale, 2005). A major issue within emerging economies has been the controlling of emissions, the rise of which has become unprecedented as the economies of these countries continue to expand. Prior work in Nigeria has illustrated a high rate of environmental pollutions led to by the expansion of oil extraction and other industrial activities (Hassan and Kouhy, 2013).  In the last few years, the country has undertaken various initiatives, including the implementation of the Kyoto protocol, as part of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. The extant literature has covered the impacts of such initiatives in the oil and energy sector (Hassan and Kouhy, 2013). However, the environmental impacts of other industries and the ways these industries are discharging their accountability have remained under-researched. The study adds to the literature by investigating how the cement industry - the second largest contributor to the socio-economic growth and development of Nigeria, (Mojekwu, 2013) - has been discharging its corporate and environmental accountability. Drawing on institutional theory, the study unfolds the types of strategies that Nigerian cement companies have adopted to report their carbon emissions and discharge environmental accountability.

We build a Markov regime switching (MRS) model where hedging and speculative pressures affect the transition probabilities between a stronger and weaker spot-futures relationship. It is found that hedging pressure increases the likelihood of transition, i.e. destabilises the existing spot-futures relationship, while speculative pressure reduces it, i.e. stabilises the relationship, in the copper, crude oil and natural gas markets, but this effect is relatively weak in the silver and heating oil markets. We also examine whether these findings generate practical benefits by testing the hedging effectiveness of the minimum variance hedge ratios (MVH) derived from the MRS models with hedging and speculative pressures. A relatively strong reduction of the portfolio variance, hedger's utility and value at risk (VaR) is observed in the energy markets.Publisher Statement: NOTICE: this is the author’s version of a work that was accepted for publication in International Review of Financial Analysis.

The findings help us understand how IF has been conceptualised by consumers in non-Muslim majority markets. The five components identified shed light on the constructs that have informed the growth of IF as an ethical option in international non-Muslim majority markets.

Even though the technology has been available for more than a decade, mobile payment has been adopted into widespread usage only in some countries, including Japan, South Korea, Kenya and the Philippines. Nonetheless, other parts of the world appear to be catching up fast and it is important for both public and private sectors to understand the determinants of mobile payment adoption. This study investigates the drivers of mobile payment adoption in the past decade through comparative studies of both developed and developing countries. Conceptual frameworks, including the network effects and broadband ecosystem, are also applied to support the analysis offered in this paper. Moreover, this study explores the similarities and differences between the above mentioned countries and why they have been more successful in adopting the mobile payment technology compared to other states, such as the US and European countries.The key finding is that a successful and widespread adoption of mobile payment requiresstrongly growing demand and ready availability of infrastructure and technology on the supply side. The rapidly growing popularity of smartphones fueled the demand side by making the new payment technology reachable by large groups of consumers. Nevertheless, the use of mobile payment could not be significantly increased without an introduction of killer applications in each country or region. This is where the regulators in both financial and telecommunication sectors play a crucial role. A good combination of regulation and/or policy on the supply and demand sides is a way forward.

We predict that board structure changes prompted by the introduction of the Ghanaian Code in 2003 should lead to better firm performance. Using a panel regression model, our results show that duality decreases firm performance pre-2003, but those firms that separate the two posts in line with the recommendations of the Ghanaian Code did not perform better than those that combined the two post-2003. While we find no relationship between board committees and firm performance pre-2003, the relationship switched to positive and statistically significant post-2003. The most consistent result we find concerns board size. However, the non-executive director representation on the board appears to have no impact on firm performance. These results show that not all board structure recommendations introduced by the Ghanaian Code are effective in achieving superior performance in Ghana.Publisher Statement: This paper is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution International License (CC BY-NC 4.0) (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-structure-of-uk-outbound-fdi-and-environmental-regulation', 'Paper_Names': 'The Structure of UK Outbound FDI And Environmental Regulation', 'Publication_Date': '22 May 2017', 'Author_Names': '  Abay Mulatu  Abay Mulatu ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/abay-mulatu https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/abay-mulatu ', 'Abstract': 'We study whether the pattern of outbound Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is influenced by host countries’ environmental regulations.

To establish whether the impact of financial openness on both bank risk and profit efficiency occurs directly or through each one of the two bank characteristics (efficiency and risk, respectively), we begin our analysis by investigating the potential reverse Granger causality between profit efficiency and risk using a dynamic simultaneous model via system GMM estimation. We then account explicitly for the role of bank risk in the estimation of bank profit efficiency using stochastic frontier analysis, allowing for the influence of different measures of financial openness and risk alongside other control variables. Our results indicate that financial openness reduces bank profit efficiency directly, not through changes in bank risk. We also find that financial openness increases bank risk indirectly, through the decreased bank profit efficiency channel.NOTICE: this is the author’s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Journal of Financial Stability.

In particular, we develop a two-level frontier-efficiency model to examine how ICT's direct and indirect impact on different components of productivity is related to the economic growth in the US. Our empirical analysis has confirmed that ICT investment does contribute to productivity but not in the usual manner – we find a positive (but lagged) ICT effect on technological progress. We argue that for a positive ICT role on growth to actually take place, a period of negative relationship between productivity and ICT investment together with ICT-using sectors’ capacity to learn from the embodied new technology was crucial. In addition, it took a learning period with appropriate complementary co-inventions for the new ICT-capital to become effective and its gains to be realized. Our findings provide solid, further empirical evidence to support ICT as a general purpose technology.Publisher Statement: NOTICE: this is the author’s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Information Economics and Policy.

The analysis is conducted on 118 MFIs over the period 2009 – 2013; adopting a static count data model and dynamic regression approach. We find that MFIs in Uganda are more likely to target richer districts during earlier years; however, poorer districts tend to catch up over time. This finding suggests that MFIs may wish to signal an improved financial performance by first establishing branches in better-off districts and then only later reaching out to poorer districts, employing cross-subsidisation. We also show that Commercial Bank MFIs are more likely to increase their presence in poorer districts than other types of MFIs, suggesting that protection against regulation and greater access to capital markets may make commercial MFIs the most qualified institutions to expand outreach to the unbanked segment of the world’s poorer population.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/risk-management-in-islamic-banks-2', 'Paper_Names': 'Risk Management in Islamic Banks', 'Publication_Date': '2016', 'Author_Names': '  Kenneth Baldwin ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/ken-baldwin ', 'Abstract': 'If ever there was a suitable time for Islamic banks to develop risk management capabilities, now is that time.

However, the view that Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) are in some way insulated from certain types or risk, namely financial return risk, which is similar to interest rate risk for conventional banks, has prevented even the first step from being successfully taken by many Islamic banks.

From the perspective of port authorities or governments, knowing the Minimum Efficient Scale (MES) is salient, because they sometimes determine the port development or expansion based on the port capacity or the existing size of the terminal. Notwithstanding the importance of knowing the exact MES, extant literature has not managed to estimate MES in the port industry. This study aims to estimate the MES in the port industry in South Korea in order to identify whether Container Terminal Operators (CTOs) are under economies of scale, constant economies of scale or diseconomies of scale; we explore a bottom point of the average cost curve in order to suggest an adequate scale for the port industry in Korea. The finding demonstrates that undercapacity may be a strong issue in Korean container ports. However, CTOs in Busan port are in an overcapacity area given the market demand of container throughput in 2013, which is approximately 25 times larger than the estimated MES; in fact, all CTOs in Busan port operate at more than 20% of MES. This study then can provide port policy makers with a helpful tool to derive ex-ante MES level at the terminal designing stage and to adjust ex-post port investment decisions at the additional port capacity designing stage, which may contribute to avoiding overcapacity.NOTICE: this is the author’s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Transport Policy.

However, not all elements of corporate governance appear to have a significant effect on firm performance.\\nResearch limitations/implications\\n\\nOne limitation of this study is the development of a corporate governance index. The binary coding used to construct the GCGI may not reflect the relative importance of the different corporate governance provisions. This means that all elements included in the index are given equal weighting. Future research may assign weights to each of the corporate governance provisions but this may have the disadvantage of making subjective judgements relative to the importance of each corporate governance provision recommended by the Ghanaian Code.\\nPractical implications\\n\\nThese results have important implications for both policy makers and companies. For policy makers, it is encouraging for the development of a code of corporate governance to regulate firms rather than enforcing rigid laws that may not be value relevant. For companies, the improvement in compliance with a code of corporate governance can provide a means of achieving improved performance.\\nOriginality/value\\n\\nThis paper adds to the limited evidence on the governance-performance relationship in developing economies and in particular it analyses the role of a governance index. It is also the first paper to compare the pre- and the post-code governance index-performance relationship in an African or developing country.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-impact-of-seaports-on-the-regional-economies-in-south-korea-p-2', 'Paper_Names': 'The impact of seaports on the regional economies in South Korea: Panel evidence from the augmented Solow model', 'Publication_Date': '12 Dec 2015', 'Author_Names': '  Jin Suk Park  Jin Suk Park ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/jin-suk-park https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/jin-suk-park ', 'Abstract': 'This study reveals the economic impact of seaports on regions in Korea.

Over the past decade or so, financial inclusion has received attention from academicians, development institutions, governments and the private sector. Drawing from the range of philosophical worldviews, which can at times seem indistinguishable especially in social science, this paper proposes that objectivism with a realist approach is foundational to academic research on financial inclusion.

In this regard, external experience of similar diversifications provides a valuable lesson pool for the focal manager. While there are many studies of internal learning in organizational learning literature, research on external learning is still scarce. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for external experiential learning and applies it to study the effect of industry experience on diversification value. We report the novel finding of a cubic relationship between external learning from industry experience and diversification value. This indicates that industry experience matters to the outcomes of strategic decisions, but that the effect of this external experience on learning is conditional upon certain characteristics of the experience: namely specificity and heterogeneity.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/what-drives-corporate-governance-quality-in-emerging-african-econ-4', 'Paper_Names': 'What drives corporate governance quality in emerging African economies?

The Ghanaian Code of corporate governance introduced in 2003 was the first attempt to make official corporate governance guidelines on best practices not backed by the force of law of which the Ghanaian firms were encouraged to comply with its provisions. As such, firms listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange are expected to comply with the recommended governance provisions in order to promote good corporate governance. Some of the key provisions in the code are separating the posts of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the board of directors, limiting the board size to between eight and sixteen directors, having at least one-third of the total membership of the board to be independent directors, and the establishment of separate board committees to be responsible for audit and executive remuneration. Other provisions call for improvement of the relationship between shareholders and managers, and provisions on financial affairs, auditing and disclosure practices. We develop a corporate governance index and its six subindices to measure firm-level governance quality. Annual reports of the Ghanaian listed firms are scored according to their governance disclosure during the whole period, 2000–2009 and pre 2003 and post 2003 introduction of the Ghanaian Code. A panel data analytical framework was used to find the determinants of strong corporate governance in Ghanaian listed firms. The empirical results over the whole period, 2000–2009 show statistically significant and positive relationship between external financing needs, firm size, institutional shareholdings and governance quality measured by the Ghanaian corporate governance index. While we find no relationship between external financing needs, director shareholding and governance quality pre 2003, the result is positive and statistically significant for post 2003. The most consistent relationship we find concerns firm size and institutional shareholdings. However, growth opportunities and firm performance measures appear to have no association with strong governance in Ghanaian firms. The results have important implications for the Ghanaian firms and regulators. In particular, the Ghanaian firms with high external financing needs would have to improve their governance structures in order to attract such facility. For regulators, it is important to have clear code of corporate governance guidelines in place where firms’ governance practices can be benchmarked. In addition, the study contributes to our understanding of the firm attributes affecting strong corporate governance in emerging African economies.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/what-drives-corporate-governance-quality-in-emerging-african-econ-3', 'Paper_Names': 'What Drives Corporate Governance Quality in Emerging African Economies?

CSR movement and CSR reportingpractices by financial sector have gathered great momentum in recent years. Banking sector is in the leading position in discharging CSR reporting.Design/methodology/approach – The sample composed of all the 30 banking companies enlisted in Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), and the study used content analysis approach for systematic categorization and analysis of the contents reported in the annual report. A total of 97 CSR items classified into seven classes were selected through a relevant literature review, as the expected itemsand average, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, percentage and correlation, etc. were used as the tools of analysis. SPSS software version 19.0 was used to analyze the data. An ordinary least square (OLS) regression model is fitted to the data for assessing the effect of independent variables on total CSRreporting score.Findings – The study found that the extent of CSR reporting in banking companies in Bangladesh varies from 27.84 to 65.98 per cent, and on an average, they report 47.39 per cent of the expected CSR items in annual report. It is also observed that banking companies in Bangladesh emphasized onlinguistic or written form than charts, graphs or pictures in reporting CSR activities to their stakeholders, and the study found no significant influence of the selected bank characteristics on the extent of CSR reporting. Moreover, the study observed significant impact of regulatory change on nature and extent of CSR reporting.Research limitations/implications – The study considered all the listed commercial banking companies in Bangladesh, and the annual report of 2011 was taken as the main source of data.Social implications – Among others, the implications of the study include the following. Banking companies are expected to get a real scenario of CSR reporting of the banking sector in Bangladesh and banking companies with poor CSR contribution expected to be motivated for contributing more in CSRactivities. Government and other regulatory bodies can also get detailed information regarding CSR reporting practices for formulating guidelines in this regard.Originality/value – This empirical study on the determinants of extent of CSR reporting using a larger number of expected CSR items contributes toward a better understanding of the CSR reporting practices of the banking companies in Bangladesh. The study used a new independent variable “CSR Expenditure” in justifying its influence on CSR reporting and identified the impact of regulatory change on CSR reporting. The study expects contributing in the enactment of more regulatory requirements for bringing the CSR reporting into a certain framework and encouraging in more CSR reporting in Bangladesh.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/does-compliance-matter-in-surveillance-of-nigerian-banks-a-critic-2', 'Paper_Names': 'Does compliance matter in surveillance of Nigerian banks?

No any framework for measuring compliance is in place by the central bank.

This paper uses a panel of countries to identify the net effect of armed conflict and terrorism, both domestic and international, on aid receipts. It shows that armed conflict has a negative effect on the amounts of both bilateral and multilateral aid. It also finds that terrorism tends to increase foreign assistance. The effect is stronger for bilateral aid; this is consistent with the expectation that they are likely to use foreign aid to directly or indirectly assist governments fighting terrorism.

State–controlled bidding firms are less likely to use cash proceeds from stock issuance to finance mergers and acquisitions, suggesting that they are more concerned with the threat of resulting corporate control change, while executives prefer cash from debt issuance to avoid dilution of voting power. Bidders with huge cash reserves are less likely to opt for any form of stock financing, which is consistent with the view that cash–rich bidders prefer internally generated funds to finance mergers and acquisitions. With regards to market performance, both cash and stock financed deals create value for bidding firms in the short–term, while stock deals perform better than cash deals in the long–term. Our further analyses show that market reactions differ in ways which suggest a difference in the market’s assessment over financing decision when the deals are paid in cash, with deals involving seasoned equity offerings outperforming those paid by internal funds and debt.

The study examines the extent to which microfinance institutions reach the poor and investigates the factors influencing participation in microfinance programmes. In addition, the study employs a propensity score matching model (PSM) to ascertain the poverty-reducing effects of participation in microfinance programmes. The empirical results shows that microfinance institutions reach more of the less poor households than the very poor households. Again, socio-economic characteristics such as gender (i.e. being a female), literacy, child dependency ratio and landholdings were found to have significant influence on the likelihood of participating in microfinance programmes. In general, the results did not show significant effect microfinance on poverty reduction. However, if we consider the effects of microfinance on poverty across sub-groups under poverty groupings, significant poverty-reducing effect of microfinance was observed for the very poor households while for the less poor the effect was not statistically significant.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/mortgage', 'Paper_Names': 'Mortgage', 'Publication_Date': 'Apr 2015', 'Author_Names': '  Lien Luu ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/lien-luu ', 'Abstract': 'NA'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/organizational-customer-orientation-employee-customer-orientation-2', 'Paper_Names': 'Organizational customer orientation, employee customer orientation and employee job performance: the moderating role of openness to experience', 'Publication_Date': '2015', 'Author_Names': '  Wei Song  Wei Song ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/wei-song https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/wei-song ', 'Abstract': 'Organizational customer orientation (OCO) refers to an organization’s continuous and proactive disposition that puts the interests of customers first.

First, the locations of structural breaks are identified by Bai and Perron’s (1998) method. Then, it is estimated how a hazard rate changes in duration between structural breaks by parametric duration analysis using the Weibull and the log-logistic hazard functions. This study reveals the evidence of positive duration dependence, that is, stability is destabilizing, in 13 out of 27 international stock indices and the pooled data. In other words, as one regime continues over time with unchanged parameter values, a new structural break is more likely to occur. This method discloses a lower degree of duration dependence than the duration-dependence Markov-switching model (Durland and McCurdy, 1994) that considers temporary switches between a limited number of regimes. Also, some new patterns are emerged, e.g., more predominant positive duration dependence in bear markets, the secondary stock exchanges of a country and developing countries.Publisher statement: This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in Applied Economics on 28th November 2014, available online: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2014.985370 .'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-economy-wide-impact-of-hivaids-and-the-funding-dilemma-in-afr', 'Paper_Names': 'The economy wide impact of HIV/AIDS and the funding dilemma in Africa: Evidence from a dynamic life cycle horizon of Uganda', 'Publication_Date': 'Sep 2015', 'Author_Names': '  Judith Kabajulizi ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/judith-kabajulizi ', 'Abstract': 'HIV/AIDS compared to the rest of the word. This paper analyses the long-term economic effects of HIV/AIDS using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Taking Uganda as a case study for analysis, the paper aims to predict the economic impact of HIV/AIDS through: (i) the human resource channel and, (ii) the source of fiscal space for HIV/AIDS channel, and proposes policy options for funding HIV interventions in the long-term. The paper shows that if the government intervenes by scaling up treatment and prevention of HIV, the negative economic impacts of HIV/AIDS – including the soaring cost of production due to rising wages, declining GDP growth rates relative to the base, and the rising domestic debt as share of GDP – are reversed. The economy thrives from a growing labour force supply and resource flows to HIV interventions. Foreign-aid and direct taxation are both potential sources of fiscal space for HIV albeit with differential impacts on sectoral growth and government debt levels. The study demonstrates that low-income-countries (LICs) like Uganda have the capacity to mobilise domestic resources to fund HIV interventions by increasing revenues from direct taxes. It is recommended that policymakers – in Uganda and other LICs grappling with similar challenges – devise means to increase revenue from direct taxes particularly by tapping into the large informal sector. The paper also proposes that in the short to medium term, development-aid for health be increased in order for government to meet the future HIV/AIDS obligations. Overall, the research findings strengthen the case for policy makers to frontload investment in HIV treatment and prevention.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-effects-of-exchange-rate-volatility-on-sectoral-exports-evide-2', 'Paper_Names': 'The effects of exchange rate volatility on sectoral exports evidence from Sweden, UK, and Germany', 'Publication_Date': '2015', 'Author_Names': '  Dimitria Serenis  Dimitris Serenis ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/dimitris-serenis https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/dimitris-serenis ', 'Abstract': 'This paper examines the effect of exchange rate volatility for a set of three European countries, Germany, Sweden and the UK, on sectoral exports for the period 1973 q1-2010 q4.

Exposure to refinancing risk is exacerbated by paying returns to providers of off balance sheet funds which do not covary with the returns of corresponding assets as they would from a stricter application of shariah principles underlying these funding structures. The active hedging of refinancing risk by Islamic banks is also challenged due to a lack of suitable hedging instruments as well as to differing shariah opinions concerning their permissibility.

Merger and acquisitions, as the dominant mode of foreign entry in Turkey, and/or the dominance of the FDI inflows in the financial sector after 2004 might be the reasons for this weak employment effect.

The presence in the economy of “bank money” and a financial system (not only constituted by banks) characterized by financial innovation and speculation fundamentally changes the nature of credit creation. As J.A. Schumpeter (1934) and other scholars (such as Shackle, 1967) have recognized the central role of credit creation in the economic system, a new perspective on the financial role in defining the growth path needs to be developed by filling the gaps in New Growth Theory (NGT) (Aghion and Howitt, 1998) and Evolutionary Theory (ET) (Nelson and Winter, 1982) - which we call the two Sons of Schumpeter - and in some way combining them. The financial instability of the economy seems to depend on the financial structure. The goal of this survey is to explain the main hypothesis of the historical passage of the economy from a virtuous to a bad cycle and to show the existence of what we label the wealth trap: that is, the consequence of the presence of a technologically advanced and greedy financial system within the economic system. This new point of view can help to answer some important questions that in the literature remain unsolved. Future extensions of this survey will develop a quantitative ABM (Agent-Based Model) able to demonstrate the existence of the “two cycles” and will finally undertake experiments to build policy proposals for the restoration of the virtuous cycle and to prevent this cycle from becoming a bad one again.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/investor-induced-contagion-during-the-banking-and-european-sovere', 'Paper_Names': 'Investor induced contagion during the banking and European sovereign debt crisis of 2007-2012: wealth effect or portfolio rebalancing?', 'Publication_Date': '5 Jul 2014', 'Author_Names': '  Daniel Santamaria  Daniel Santamaria ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/daniel-santamaria https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/daniel-santamaria ', 'Abstract': 'This study investigates the way a crisis spreads within a country and across borders by testing the investor induced contagion hypothesis through the liquidity channel on stock-bond relationships of the US and five European countries before and during the global banking and European sovereign debt crisis of 2007-2012.

Findings of the study suggested that in most of the cases, Islamic indices are moving almost together with their conventional counterpart (except a few cases) over the observation period.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/mergers-and-acquisitions-and-cash-payments-evidence-from-china', 'Paper_Names': 'Mergers and acquisitions and cash payments: Evidence from China', 'Publication_Date': '2014', 'Author_Names': '  Christopher Muganhu ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/christopher-muganhu ', 'Abstract': 'NA'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/political-uncertainty-and-stock-market-volatility-in-the-middle-e-2', 'Paper_Names': 'Political uncertainty and stock market volatility in the Middle East and North African (MENA) countries', 'Publication_Date': '1 Nov 2013', 'Author_Names': '  Jun Wang  Jun Wang ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/jun-wang https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/jun-wang ', 'Abstract': 'This paper examines the impact of political uncertainty (caused by the civil uprisings in the Arab World i.e., “Arab Spring”) on the volatility of major stock markets in the MENA region. Our main findings are as follows. First, by distinguishing between conventional and Islamic stock market indices, we find that these two groups of investments react heterogeneously to the recent political turmoil. Specifically, we document a significant increase in the volatility of Islamic indices during the period of political unrests whereas the uprisings have had little or no significant effect on the volatility in conventional markets. Such difference is confirmed by further analysis in a multivariate GARCH model. Second, regardless of its impact on volatility, there is little evidence to suggest that MENA markets have become more integrated with international markets after the political revolution. Third, similar results are not found for the benchmark indices which indicate that the changes are the result of political tensions. In general, these results are robust to model specification and consistent with the notion that political uncertainty contributes to financial volatility. Overall, the findings are important in understanding the role of political uncertainty on stock market stability and are of great significance to investors and market regulators.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/shariah-compliance-in-islamic-banking-an-empirical-study-on-selec', 'Paper_Names': 'Shari’ah compliance in Islamic banking: An empirical study on selected Islamic banks in Bangladesh', 'Publication_Date': '15 Mar 2014', 'Author_Names': '  Hafij Ullah ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/hafij-ullah ', 'Abstract': 'Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the Shari’ah compliance status of the Islamic banks in Bangladesh.Design/methodology/approach – The research was based on both primary and secondary materials. The primary data were gathered through sample questionnaire survey and personal interviews by the researcher; the secondary data were obtained from Qur’an, Hadiths, different circulars/letters, manuals, research books and journals, annual reports, Web sites of the sample banks.Statistical tools and techniques like weighted average, percentage, SD, variance and correlation between Shari’ah violation score and bank-specific attributes were used applying statistical software Statistical Package for Social Science (version 17.0).Findings – Shari’ah compliance status of the Islamic banks in Bangladesh is in a vulnerable condition, Shari’ah compliance status highly varies among the Islamic banks, and Shari’ah violation is high in investing activities because of lack of knowledge, lack of sincerity in complying Shari’ah, poor attention in Shari’ah audit and Shari’ah research and lack of strong Shari’ah supervisory board comprising full-time skillful members.Practical implications – Among others, the major policy implications of this study are as follows: regulatory bodies and Shari’ah board members are expected to have guidelines from this study to find their limitations and to determine their future responsibilities; executives and Employees are expected to get the idea of present state of Shari’ah compliance and to identify their weaknesses in this regard; clients and other stakeholders are expected to have guidelines to choose the better Islamic banks to perform banking transactions; and the researchers in Islamic banking may usefully use the issues raised in this article for more comprehensive studies in Islamic banking and Shari’ah compliance.Originality/value – The paper opens a new avenue in justifying the status of Shari’ah compliance with a new dataset and correlating Shari’ah violation score with bank-specific attributes.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/social-interaction', 'Paper_Names': 'Social interaction', 'Publication_Date': '2014', 'Author_Names': '  Yu Wang ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/tori-wang ', 'Abstract': 'NA'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/stock-price-and-volume-effects-associated-with-changes-in-the-com', 'Paper_Names': 'Stock Price and Volume Effects Associated with Changes in the Composition of the FTSE Bursa Malaysian KLCI', 'Publication_Date': '11 Feb 2014', 'Author_Names': '  Mohamad Nazri Abd Karim ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/mohamad-nazri-abd-karim ', 'Abstract': 'We examine the stock price and volume effects of changes in the composition of the FTSE Bursa Malaysia Kuala Lumpur Composite Index (KLCI), over the time period of 2005 to 2012.

The use of the three estimation method is in order to make a meaningful comparison between the models.Findings– The findings indicate that there are similarities and differences in the capital structure determinants on the two sets of firms: banks tend to be more leveraged when they are more profitable and manufacturing firms tend to be less leveraged when they are profitable. In addition, banks adjust their leverage faster at a speed of 69 per cent than manufacturing firms at 46 per cent. The study also shows that changes in the economy influence the capital structure of financial firms more than that of manufacturing firms.Research limitations/implications– The study only focused on one economy.Practical implications– As a result of 2008 global financial crisis, there has been intense debate on the significance of regulatory capital.

It suggests that this neglected dimension of the experience of Chinese international students in Britain is significant for both their personal well-being and educational outcomes.In the course of my research, nine academic lectures with a total duration of 12 hours and 50 minutes were recorded in two university departments in England. Interviews and group discussions were conducted with 39 Chinese students who attended these lectures regarding potential humour they perceived in the lectures. The lecturers of these lectures were also interviewed. Data analysis shows that many of the Chinese participants encountered difficulty at various levels in understanding humour in the lectures. In many cases they attributed the lack of comprehension to their language problems in a conventional sense, e.g. in relation to vocabulary, speech speed and accents, but they seldom referred to difficulty caused by cultural allusions within the humour. Some participants claimed that ‘British humour’ was particularly perplexing, but there is recurring evidence in my data showing similarities between the lecturers’ and the Chinese participants’ humour, challenging the latter group’s accounts of the inherent difference between humour in the two cultures they represent.Various studies have reported a particular pattern of socialisation of Chinese students in the U.K.: Chinese students experience much less interaction with British people than they expect, and fall into the habit of stereotyping British people and themselves. In my study, the Chinese students’ discrimination between two national categories of humour may be seen as an example of this habit in action. In my presentation, I will argue that this habit presents clear dangers, and that the students’ tendency to stereotype and to auto-stereotype is an issue requiring further academic attention.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/accounting-for-corporate-environmental-responsibility-in-emerging', 'Paper_Names': 'Accounting for corporate environmental responsibility in emerging economies: The study from Nigeria', 'Publication_Date': '9 Apr 2013', 'Author_Names': '  Abdurafiu Noah ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/abdurafiu-noah ', 'Abstract': 'NA'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/armed-conflict-terrorism-and-the-allocation-of-foreign-aid', 'Paper_Names': 'Armed Conflict, Terrorism, and the Allocation of Foreign Aid', 'Publication_Date': '2013', 'Author_Names': '  Piotr Lis ', 'Author_Links': ' https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/piotr-lis ', 'Abstract': 'Armed conflict and terrorism have damaging impacts on economic development through disruption of economic activity and trade and the destruction of resources, both human and capital. They can also have another indirect effect through their impact on aid, but the likely net effect is not obvious. The impact on the economy and polity may well discourage aid donors and lead to a reduction in aid. On the other hand donors may provide aid as a reimbursement for counter-terrorist efforts that benefit the donor country. This paper tries to identify the net effect using a panel of countries. It finds that armed conflict does have a large and negative effect on both multilateral and bilateral aid, but that bilateral donors also seem to turn a blind eye to violence in oil exporting countries. It also finds that while international terrorism tends to increase bilateral aid, bilateral donors seem indifferent to domestic terrorism. In contrast, multilateral aid is found not to react to international terrorism, but does react to its domestic terrorism.'}, {'Paper_Links': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/do-company-directors-underestimate-the-adoption-of-corporate-gove', 'Paper_Names': 'Do company directors underestimate the adoption of corporate governance provisions?

Using a survey approach, the respondents, who were company executives and non-executive directors with knowledge of the Ghanaian Code and its provisions, regard the code as a benchmark for good corporate governance practices within Ghanaian listed firms. They also report some improvement in the standard of corporate governance in their companies since the introduction of the Code. Many of the company directors indicated their preparedness to comply with further corporate governance requirements, such as the adoption of a formal nomination committee something not been currently included in the Ghanaian Code. However, the directors noted that they receive inadequate support from the regulatory and institutional bodies for the implementation of the Ghanaian Code provisions. Many of the directors also supported the review of the Ghanaian Code by an independent committee. With regard to the adoption of the Ghanaian Code and its influence on firm performance, the respondents indicated that the adoption of the specific governance provisions in the area of chief executive officer (CEO)/chairman roles separation, having a balance of executive and non-executive directors on the board, the establishment of audit and remuneration committees, and the full adoption of the Ghanaian Code provisions were all influential in determining firm performance. They, however, did not support the adoption of the board size provision as influential to firm performance.

This study applies panel data regression techniques to 10,639 firm-year observations of non-financial Chinese listed firms during 2003–2010 to examine the relationship between state ownership and firm performance. The results show that state ownership has a U-shaped relationship with firm performance. The Split Share Structure Reform in 2005–2006 played a positive role in enhancing the relationship between state ownership and firm profitability ratios. Although state ownership decreased significantly after 2006, it remains high in strategically important industry sectors such as the oil, natural gas and mining sector and the publishing, broadcasting and media sector. The findings reveal that a higher level of state ownership is superior to a dispersed ownership structure due to the benefits of government support and political connections. The Split Share Structure Reform made previously non-tradable shares legally tradable, improving corporate governance and reducing the negative effect of non-tradable state shares.\\n\\nPublisher statement: This is an Open Access report distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/), which permits users to copy, distribute and transmit the work for non-commercial purposes providing it is properly cited.'}]\n",
